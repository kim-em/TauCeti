# Minimal projective presentations

A **projective presentation** of a module `M` is an exact sequence `P₁ → P₀ → M → 0` with `P₀` and
`P₁` projective. It is **minimal** when both of its maps are as small as they can be: `P₀ → M` is a
projective cover (`TauCeti.IsProjectiveCover`) and `P₁` covers the syzygy `ker (P₀ → M)`, again as
a projective cover. This file supplies the predicate `TauCeti.IsMinimalProjectivePresentation` and
the comparison theorem that makes it useful.

The minimality is packaged as two superfluous kernels rather than as a nested
`TauCeti.IsProjectiveCover`, because the second cover is a map into the submodule `ker p₀` and
carrying its corestriction around in the definition would make every consumer corestrict as well.
`TauCeti.IsMinimalProjectivePresentation.isProjectiveCover_codRestrict` reads the definition back
in the corestricted form, and `TauCeti.IsProjectiveCover.isMinimalProjectivePresentation` builds a
minimal presentation from a pair of covers, so the two readings are interchangeable.

The theorem the notion exists for is that a minimal projective presentation is a *quotient* of every
projective presentation: given any projective presentation of the same module there are
**surjections** from it onto the minimal one commuting with both maps
(`TauCeti.IsMinimalProjectivePresentation.exists_surjective`). Applying that to a second minimal
presentation and reading the surjections back through the uniqueness of projective covers makes
them isomorphisms, so a minimal projective presentation is unique up to isomorphism of the whole
diagram (`TauCeti.IsMinimalProjectivePresentation.exists_linearEquiv`). That uniqueness is what
lets a construction be made *from* a minimal presentation: the Auslander-Reiten transpose `Tr M`,
the cokernel of `Hom(−, A)` applied to a minimal projective presentation of `M`, is well defined
because of it.

*Existence* is a separate matter, exactly as for projective covers: it is a condition on the ring,
discharged over a semiprimary ring in
`TauCeti/Algebra/Module/MinimalProjectivePresentation/Existence.lean` by covering `M` and then
covering its syzygy. Nothing here assumes it; every statement is conditional on a presentation being
given, and `TauCeti.IsProjectiveCover.isMinimalProjectivePresentation` is the step that turns two
covers into one presentation.

What *is* proved here about the size of a presentation is that a noetherian middle term forces a
finitely generated left-hand source (`TauCeti.IsMinimalProjectivePresentation.finite`): the syzygy
cut out of a noetherian module is finitely generated, and the left-hand source covers that. Neither
the ring nor the presented module is constrained; over a noetherian ring presenting a finitely
generated module the middle term is finitely generated, hence noetherian, which is how a consumer
gets there. This is the finiteness a construction made from a presentation needs — the
Auslander-Reiten transpose is the cokernel of `Hom(−, A)` applied to one, and its vanishing
criterion asks for a finitely generated `P₁`.

The file is layered by the coefficients each part needs, as
`TauCeti/Algebra/Module/ProjectiveCover/Basic.lean` is. The predicate itself and the two cover-form
readings of it need only a semiring and additive monoids. The degeneration over a projective
module needs the presented module to be an additive group, that being what uniqueness of covers
needs. The comparison and uniqueness theorems need a ring, which the syzygy forces rather than the
proofs choosing it: they apply the cover statements of
`TauCeti/Algebra/Module/ProjectiveCover/Basic.lean` to the syzygy `ker p₀` as the *covered* module,
and those are stated for a covered module that is
an additive group. A submodule of an additive group is itself an additive group only once the
scalars form a ring — `Submodule.addCommGroup` is a `[Ring R]` instance, and over a semiring a
submodule need not be closed under negation, as `ℕ ⊆ ℤ` shows — so over a semiring
`↥(LinearMap.ker p₀)` carries no `AddCommGroup` structure at all.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.IsMinimalProjectivePresentation p₁ p₀`: `p₀` is a projective cover of `M`, the source of
  `p₁` is projective, `range p₁ = ker p₀`, and `ker p₁` is superfluous.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.IsMinimalProjectivePresentation.exact`: the two maps do form a presentation.
* `TauCeti.IsMinimalProjectivePresentation.isProjectiveCover_codRestrict` and
  `TauCeti.IsProjectiveCover.isMinimalProjectivePresentation`: minimality read as `p₁` being a
  projective cover of the syzygy, in both directions.
* `TauCeti.IsMinimalProjectivePresentation.exists_surjective`: **a minimal projective presentation
  is a quotient of every projective presentation**, by a pair of surjections commuting with the
  maps.
* `TauCeti.IsMinimalProjectivePresentation.bijective_of_comp_eq` and
  `TauCeti.IsMinimalProjectivePresentation.exists_linearEquiv`: **uniqueness**, first as
  bijectivity of any pair of comparison maps between two minimal presentations and then as an
  isomorphism of the whole diagram. The accompanying isomorphism of syzygies needs neither
  left-hand map and so is stated one layer down, as
  `TauCeti.IsProjectiveCover.nonempty_linearEquiv_ker` for the two right-hand covers.
* `TauCeti.IsMinimalProjectivePresentation.bijective_of_projective`,
  `TauCeti.IsMinimalProjectivePresentation.eq_zero_of_projective` and
  `TauCeti.IsMinimalProjectivePresentation.subsingleton_of_projective`: over a projective module
  the presentation degenerates, `P₀ ≅ M` and `P₁ = 0`.
* `TauCeti.IsMinimalProjectivePresentation.range_le_jacobson` and
  `TauCeti.IsMinimalProjectivePresentation.ker_le_jacobson`: both kernels sit inside the radical,
  the standard quantitative form of minimality.
* `TauCeti.IsMinimalProjectivePresentation.finite`: a minimal projective presentation whose middle
  term is noetherian has a finitely generated left-hand source.
