# Superfluous submodules

A submodule `N` of `M` is **superfluous** (also called *small*) when it is dispensable for
generating `M`: whenever `N ⊔ K = ⊤` for a submodule `K`, already `K = ⊤`. Superfluous submodules
are the dual notion to essential submodules, and an epimorphism `P ↠ M` is a projective cover
exactly when `P` is projective and its kernel is superfluous in `P`.

Mathlib has neither this predicate nor projective covers. This file supplies the predicate with
its lattice API and identifies it, on the modules where the comparison is available, with being
contained in the radical `Module.jacobson`.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.IsSuperfluous`: `N ⊔ K = ⊤` forces `K = ⊤`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.isSuperfluous_iff`: the definition, restated so that superfluity can be proved
  downstream.
* `TauCeti.isSuperfluous_bot`, `TauCeti.IsSuperfluous.mono`, `TauCeti.isSuperfluous_sup_iff`: the
  superfluous submodules of `M` are closed downwards and under binary suprema, and contain `⊥`.
* `TauCeti.isSuperfluous_top_iff`: `⊤` is superfluous exactly for the zero module.
* `TauCeti.IsSuperfluous.map`: the image of a superfluous submodule under any linear map is
  superfluous; `TauCeti.isSuperfluous_map_equiv_iff` records that along an equivalence this is an
  equivalence.
* `TauCeti.IsSuperfluous.comap`: the preimage of a superfluous submodule under a surjection whose
  kernel is superfluous is again superfluous. This is what makes projective covers compose.
* `TauCeti.IsSuperfluous.surjective_of_surjective_comp` and
  `TauCeti.isSuperfluous_ker_iff_forall_surjective`: a surjection has superfluous kernel exactly
  when it is an *essential epimorphism*, that is, when every map into its source whose composite
  with it is onto is itself onto. This is the minimality that makes a projective cover a
  projective cover. Both directions need differences, so they are stated for modules over a
  semiring that are additive groups.
* `TauCeti.IsSuperfluous.le_coatom` and `TauCeti.IsSuperfluous.le_jacobson`: a superfluous
  submodule lies in every coatom, hence in the radical `Module.jacobson R M`.
* `TauCeti.isSuperfluous_iff_le_jacobson`: over a module whose submodule lattice is coatomic — in
  particular over a finitely generated module — the converse holds, so the superfluous submodules
  are exactly the submodules of the radical, and
  `TauCeti.isSuperfluous_jacobson` records that the radical itself is then superfluous.
* `TauCeti.isSuperfluous_smul_top_of_isNilpotent`: the form of Nakayama's lemma that needs no
  hypothesis on the module at all — a nilpotent ideal times any module is superfluous in it.
