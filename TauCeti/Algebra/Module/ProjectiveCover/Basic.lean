# Projective covers

A **projective cover** of a module `M` is a surjection `f : P →ₗ[R] M` from a projective module
whose kernel is superfluous in `P` (`TauCeti.IsSuperfluous`). Mathlib has projective objects but no
projective covers; this file supplies the predicate and the two facts everything downstream rests
on.

Both rest on the minimality packaged in `TauCeti.IsSuperfluous.surjective_of_surjective_comp`: over
a covering module that is an additive group, a map into the source of a cover whose composite with
the cover is onto is itself onto, the kernel of a cover being too small for the image of such a map
to miss it. This is the sense in which the superfluous-kernel condition makes a cover *minimal*,
and read backwards it is `TauCeti.isProjectiveCover_iff_forall_surjective`: over an additive group
the covers of `M` are exactly the essential epimorphisms onto `M` from a projective module. Both
directions need differences, so neither is available for a covering module that is only a monoid.

The first fact is that a projective cover receives every projective presentation: if `Q` is
projective and `g : Q →ₗ[R] M` is surjective, then `g` factors as `f ∘ₗ h` with `h : Q →ₗ[R] P`
**surjective** (`TauCeti.IsProjectiveCover.exists_surjective`); taking for `Q` the finite free
module on a generating family, this reads off that a cover of a finitely generated module is itself
finitely generated (`TauCeti.IsProjectiveCover.finite`). The second is that a projective cover is
unique: any two projective covers of `M` differ by a linear equivalence commuting with the covering
maps (`TauCeti.IsProjectiveCover.exists_linearEquiv`). Uniqueness is what makes "the"
projective cover a well-defined object, and hence what makes the Cartan matrix `Cᵢⱼ = [Pᵢ : Sⱼ]` of
a finite-dimensional algebra well defined.

*Existence* of projective covers is a separate matter: over a semiperfect ring every *finitely
generated* module has one, while existence for arbitrary modules is a strictly stronger condition
on the ring, met for instance by a semiprimary ring — a finite-dimensional algebra among them.
Nothing here proves or assumes it; every statement below is conditional on a cover being given, and
`TauCeti/Algebra/Module/ProjectiveCover/Existence.lean` supplies covers over a semiprimary ring.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.IsProjectiveCover`: `f : P →ₗ[R] M` is surjective, `P` is projective, and `ker f` is
  superfluous.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.isProjectiveCover_id`: a projective module is its own projective cover.
* `TauCeti.isProjectiveCover_iff_forall_surjective`: a surjection from a projective module that is
  an additive group is a projective cover exactly when it is an essential epimorphism.
* `TauCeti.IsProjectiveCover.exists_surjective`: every surjection onto `M` from a projective module
  factors through a projective cover by a surjection.
* `TauCeti.IsProjectiveCover.finite`: a projective cover of a finitely generated module is finitely
  generated.
* `TauCeti.IsProjectiveCover.bijective_of_comp_eq` and
  `TauCeti.IsProjectiveCover.exists_linearEquiv`: **uniqueness**, first as bijectivity of any
  comparison map between two covers and then as the existence of an isomorphism over `M`.
* `TauCeti.IsProjectiveCover.nonempty_linearEquiv_ker`: uniqueness read on the kernels — the syzygy
  cut out by a projective cover of `M` is independent of the cover.
* `TauCeti.IsProjectiveCover.comp`: composing a projective cover with a surjection that itself
  has superfluous kernel again gives a projective cover.
* `TauCeti.IsProjectiveCover.ker_le_jacobson`: the kernel of a projective cover lies in the radical
  of the covering module.
* `TauCeti.isProjectiveCover_mkQ_iff`: the concrete family of covers, `P ↠ P ⧸ N` is a projective
  cover of a projective `P` exactly when `N` is superfluous; over a coatomic submodule lattice
  `TauCeti.isProjectiveCover_mkQ_iff_le_jacobson` reads this off the radical, so that `R ↠ R ⧸ I`
  is a projective cover exactly when `I ≤ Ring.jacobson R`. For a nilpotent ideal `I`,
  `TauCeti.isProjectiveCover_mkQ_smul_top_of_isNilpotent` covers the top `P ⧸ I • P` by `P`.
* `TauCeti.IsProjectiveCover.exists_comp_eq`: every map from a covering module into a semisimple
  module factors through the cover, and `TauCeti.IsProjectiveCover.homEquivOfIsSemisimpleModule`:
  precomposition with a projective cover `f : P →ₗ[R] M` is an isomorphism
  `Hom_R(M, T) ≃ₗ[k] Hom_R(P, T)` for every semisimple `T`.

## References

Uniqueness, proved here, is what makes "the" projective cover of a module a well-defined object;
that a cover exists at all is a condition on the ring, established for a semiprimary ring — a
finite-dimensional algebra among them — in
`TauCeti/Algebra/Module/ProjectiveCover/Existence.lean`. The dual notion, an injective envelope,
is an essential monomorphism into an injective module; nothing here is used for it.
