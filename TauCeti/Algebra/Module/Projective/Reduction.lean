# Projective modules are determined by a radical quotient

Projective modules over a ring whose submodule lattices are coatomic (for instance, finitely
generated projective modules) are determined by their reductions modulo an ideal in the Jacobson
radical.  Indeed, the quotient map from a projective module to its reduction
is a projective cover, and uniqueness of projective covers identifies the two projective modules.

This is the algebraic lifting step used when integral projective modules are compared through a
residue-field calculation.  The result applies to noncommutative rings and does not require the
ideal itself to be the whole Jacobson radical.

When the radical quotient `R ⧸ J` of the ring is finite, as for a finite ring or for the group
algebra of a finite group over `ℤ_p`, the radical quotient `P ⧸ J • P` of a finitely generated
module is semisimple and is determined by its composition factors. These are counted by the
numbers of maps from `P` to the simple modules, `#Hom(P, S) = #End(S) ^ [P ⧸ J • P : S]`, so a
finitely generated projective module is determined by the numbers `#Hom(P, S)`. This is the form in
which a computation of such counts, for instance through characters, identifies a projective
module.

## Main results

* `Ideal.nonempty_linearEquiv_of_quotient_smul_top`: two projective modules with coatomic
  submodule lattices (e.g. finitely generated ones) and isomorphic quotients by an ideal in the
  Jacobson radical are isomorphic.
* `TauCeti.finite_quotient_jacobson_smul_top`: over a ring with finite radical quotient, the
  radical quotient of a finitely generated module is finite.
* `TauCeti.nonempty_linearEquiv_of_projective_of_natCard_linearMap_eq`: over a ring with finite
  radical quotient, two finitely generated projective modules with equally many maps to every
  simple module are isomorphic.

/-- **Projectives are determined by a radical quotient.** If `I` lies in the Jacobson radical of
`R`, then an `R`-linear equivalence between `M / IM` and `N / IN` implies that the projective
modules `M` and `N` are `R`-linearly equivalent, provided their submodule lattices are coatomic
(as is the case for finitely generated modules).

Only existence of the resulting equivalence is asserted: both quotient maps are projective covers
of the same reduced module, so uniqueness of projective covers identifies their sources. -/

/-- **Projectives are determined by their maps to simple modules**, over a ring `R` whose radical
quotient `R ⧸ J` is finite (a finite ring, or the group algebra of a finite group over `ℤ_p`).
Two finitely generated projective `R`-modules `P` and `Q` are isomorphic as soon as, for every
simple module `S`, there are as many `R`-linear maps `P → S` as `Q → S`.

The number of maps `P → S` is `#End_R(S) ^ [P ⧸ J • P : S]`, and `End_R(S)` is a finite ring with
at least two elements, so the hypothesis says that the semisimple radical quotients of `P` and `Q`
have the same composition factors. They are then isomorphic, and projective covers lift the
isomorphism to `P ≃ Q`. -/
