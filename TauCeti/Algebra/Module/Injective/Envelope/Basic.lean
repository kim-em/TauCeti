# Injective envelopes

An **injective envelope** of a module `M` is an embedding `f : M →ₗ[R] Q` into an injective module
whose image is essential in `Q` (`TauCeti.IsEssential`). This is the notion dual to the projective
cover of `TauCeti/Algebra/Module/ProjectiveCover/Basic.lean`; Mathlib has injective objects but no
injective envelopes, and this file supplies the predicate together with the two facts everything
downstream rests on.

Both rest on the minimality packaged in `TauCeti.IsEssential.injective_of_injective_comp`: a map
out of the target of an envelope whose composite with the envelope is injective is itself
injective, the image of an envelope being too large for the kernel of such a map to avoid it. This
is the sense in which the essential-image condition makes an envelope *minimal*, and read backwards
it is `TauCeti.isInjectiveEnvelope_iff_forall_injective`: the envelopes of `M` are exactly the
essential monomorphisms from `M` into an injective module.

The first fact is that an essential extension maps into every embedding into an injective module:
if `Q'` is injective and `g : M →ₗ[R] Q'` is injective, then `g` factors as `h ∘ₗ f` with
`h : Q →ₗ[R] Q'` **injective** (`TauCeti.IsEssential.exists_injective`, stated at the
essential-monomorphism level its proof uses and specialized to an envelope through
`TauCeti.IsInjectiveEnvelope.isEssential_range`). The second is that an injective envelope is
unique: any two injective envelopes of `M` differ by a linear equivalence commuting with the
structure maps (`TauCeti.IsInjectiveEnvelope.exists_linearEquiv`). Uniqueness is what makes "the"
injective envelope a well-defined object.

*Existence* of injective envelopes is a separate matter, and is not proved here; nothing below
assumes it, every statement being conditional on an envelope being given. Over a finite-dimensional
algebra the indecomposable injectives arise as the envelopes of the simple modules.

## Universes

Mathlib's `Module.Injective` states its extension property only for source and target in the
universe of the injective module, and the universe-polymorphic form
`Module.Injective.extension_property` costs a `Small.{·} R` hypothesis on the ring. That hypothesis
is carried here on exactly the results that extend a map along an embedding, once per module used
as an extension target; it is automatic whenever `R` and that module live in the same universe.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.IsInjectiveEnvelope`: `f : M →ₗ[R] Q` is injective, `Q` is an injective module, and the
  range of `f` is essential.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.isInjectiveEnvelope_id`: an injective module is its own injective envelope.
* `TauCeti.isInjectiveEnvelope_iff_forall_injective`: an embedding into an injective module is an
  injective envelope exactly when it is an essential monomorphism.
* `TauCeti.IsEssential.exists_injective`: a given embedding of `M` with essential range maps, by an
  embedding, into every embedding of `M` into an injective module. When its own target is moreover
  injective — that is, when the given embedding is an injective envelope — this is the universal
  property of the envelope.
* `TauCeti.IsInjectiveEnvelope.bijective_of_comp_eq` and
  `TauCeti.IsInjectiveEnvelope.exists_linearEquiv`: **uniqueness**, first as bijectivity of any
  comparison map between two envelopes and then as the existence of an isomorphism under `M`.
* `TauCeti.IsInjectiveEnvelope.comp`: precomposing an injective envelope with an embedding that
  itself has essential range again gives an injective envelope.
* `TauCeti.isInjectiveEnvelope_subtype_iff`: the concrete family of envelopes, `N ↪ Q` is an
  injective envelope of a submodule `N` of an injective `Q` exactly when `N` is essential; over an
  atomic submodule lattice `TauCeti.isEssential_iff_forall_atom_le` reads this off the simple
  submodules.

## References

This implements the injective-envelope half of the "projective covers and injective envelopes"
bullet of Layer 3 of `TauCetiRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/QuiverRepresentations/README.md`
("dually `injectiveEnvelope M`"), whose projective half is
`TauCeti/Algebra/Module/ProjectiveCover/Basic.lean`. As on the projective side, the bullet is not
discharged by this file: existence of envelopes, and hence a canonical `injectiveEnvelope M`
chosen by it, remains.

whose composite with `f` is injective is injective already
