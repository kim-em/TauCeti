# `sl₂` pairs whose raising and lowering elements square to zero

Let `H`, `E`, `F` satisfy the `sl₂` relations for the ring commutator of an associative ring, as in
`TauCeti/Algebra/Lie/Sl2/Associative.lean`, and assume in addition that `E` and `F` square to zero.
For a representation over a characteristic-zero field, that means the `α`-string through every
weight has length at most two, so the module is a sum of copies of the trivial and the standard
two-dimensional representation. This file records what that hypothesis buys.

First it halves the relation `H E - E H = 2 E` to `E F E = E`: once `E ^ 2 = 0` both `H E` and
`-E H` are already equal to `E F E`. This needs only an additively torsion-free ring, with no
identity element required. The two products `E F` and `F E` then become orthogonal idempotents whose
difference is `H`, cutting out the two ends of each `α`-string.

Second, a square-zero element makes the exponential `1 + t E` affine in its parameter, and the
Chevalley rank-one identity

```text
x_α(u) x_{-α}(-u⁻¹) x_α(u) = h_α(u) n_α,      n_α = x_α(1) x_{-α}(-1) x_α(1),
```

holds over every commutative coefficient ring, at every unit `u`, because both sides equal
`1 + u E - u⁻¹ F - E F - F E`. The left-hand side is the triple product computed in
`triple_product_of_mul_self_eq_zero`, and the right-hand side is the diagonal element
`1 + (u - 1) E F + (u⁻¹ - 1) F E` rescaling the two root terms of that normal form at parameters
`(1, -1)`, which is `torus_mul_triple_product_of_mul_self_eq_zero`. Neither step divides by
anything: the square-zero hypothesis truncates every divided-power exponential after its first
term, so no denominator is ever introduced.

Finally, on an additively torsion-free module over any semiring, an integer eigenvector of `H`
has eigenvalue `1`, `0` or `-1`. The two products select its component at each outer eigenvalue.

Together these are the rank-one inputs to the scheme-theoretic root generation of an explicit
Chevalley--Demazure carrier whose representation has short `α`-strings, the standard symplectic
carrier of type `Cₙ` among them.

## Main results

* `e_mul_f_mul_e_of_mul_self_eq_zero` and `f_mul_e_mul_f_of_mul_self_eq_zero`: the halved `sl₂`
  relations `E F E = E` and `F E F = F`.
* `triple_product_of_mul_self_eq_zero`: the normal form of `(1 + α E) (1 + β F) (1 + α E)` when
  `α β = -1`, over an arbitrary commutative coefficient ring.
* `torus_mul_triple_product_of_mul_self_eq_zero`: multiplying that normal form at `(1, -1)` by a
  diagonal element rescales its two root terms.
* `mul_apply_of_eq_zsmul`: an integer eigenvector of `H` has eigenvalue `1`, `0` or `-1`,
  and in the outer two cases it is fixed by one of the two idempotents and killed by the other.
