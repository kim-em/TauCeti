# Derivations of the split octonions

`G₂` is the derivation algebra of the split octonions, and its fundamental representation is
supposed to be the `7`-dimensional space of imaginary octonions. Neither statement can even be made
until one knows that a derivation of `𝕆` lands in the imaginary octonions and respects the norm
form; that is what this file proves first. It then writes down fourteen independent derivations
and shows that there are no others, so that `Der 𝕆 ≅ 𝔰𝔩₃ × R³ × R³` and `finrank (Der 𝕆) = 14`.

Let `D` be a derivation of `TauCeti.Octonion R`. Applying `D` to the rank-two equation
`x² = tr x · x - N x · 1` and to the polarization
`x * conj y + y * conj x = ⟨x, y⟩ · 1` of the norm gives one
identity in `𝕆`,

`tr (D x) · x = ⟨x, D x⟩ · 1`,

and everything follows from it. Evaluated at the diagonal idempotent `e = ⟨1, 0, 0, 0⟩` — an
element whose existence is exactly the splitness of `𝕆` — its two diagonal entries read
`tr (D e) = ⟨e, D e⟩` and `0 = ⟨e, D e⟩`. Polarizing it and feeding `e` into the second slot forces
`tr (D x) = 0` for **every** `x`, and with the trace gone the identity itself collapses to
`⟨x, D x⟩ = 0`: a derivation is skew for the norm form.

So `D` maps all of `𝕆` into the imaginary octonions, commutes with conjugation, and lies in the
orthogonal Lie algebra of the norm: `Der 𝕆 ≤ 𝔰𝔬(N)`
(`TauCeti.Octonion.derivationLieAlgebra_le_skewAdjointLieSubalgebra`). In particular the imaginary
octonions are a Lie submodule (`TauCeti.Octonion.imaginaryLieSubmodule`) — over a field in which
`2` is nonzero this is the `7`-dimensional fundamental representation — and `Der 𝕆` acts faithfully
on it over every commutative ring. Indeed, the diagonal idempotent `e` is a product of two
imaginary vector matrices, and `𝕆 = R · e ⊕ Im 𝕆`, so a derivation vanishing on `Im 𝕆` vanishes on
all of `𝕆`.

The derivations exhibited here come from the action of `SL₃` on a Zorn vector matrix,
`⟨a, b, v, w⟩ ↦ ⟨a, b, A v, (Aᵀ)⁻¹ w⟩`, differentiated at the identity: a trace-zero matrix `M`
acts by `M` on the upper vector entry and by `-Mᵀ` on the lower one
(`TauCeti.Octonion.slDerivation`), and this is a homomorphism of Lie algebras `𝔰𝔩₃ → Der 𝕆`. The
Leibniz rule for it is the identity `(M u) ⨯₃ w + u ⨯₃ (M w) = -(Mᵀ (u ⨯₃ w))`, valid exactly
because `M` has trace zero
(`Matrix.mulVec_cross_add_cross_mulVec_of_trace_eq_zero`). Two further three-parameter families
(`TauCeti.Octonion.upperDerivation` and `TauCeti.Octonion.lowerDerivation`) are attached to a
vector `u`, are read off the idempotent `⟨1, 0, 0, 0⟩`, and exchange the two vector entries; there
they are the two nonzero pieces of the `ℤ/3`-grading of `𝕆` by scalar diagonal, upper vector and
lower vector. That grading is visible in the five brackets between the three families: `𝔰𝔩₃` acts
on the upper family by its defining representation and on the lower one by the dual, two upper or
two lower derivations bracket into the opposite vector family by twice the cross product, and an
upper against a lower one brackets back into `𝔰𝔩₃` through `TauCeti.Octonion.slOfVectors`.
Together the three families depend on `8 + 3 + 3 = 14` independent parameters, so
`14 ≤ finrank (Der 𝕆)`.

Conversely every derivation `D` is in the family, over any commutative ring. Its value at the
idempotent `e = ⟨1, 0, 0, 0⟩` has vanishing diagonal entries, so subtracting the upper and the lower
derivation attached to its two vector entries leaves a derivation `E` that kills `e`. Such an `E`
respects the Peirce decomposition of `𝕆` relative to `e`: differentiating `e x = x` and `x e = 0`
for an upper vector matrix `x` (and their mirrors for a lower one) shows that `E` acts on the upper
entry by some matrix `M`, on the lower entry by some matrix `N`, and kills the diagonal. The product
of an upper and a lower vector matrix is diagonal, which forces `N = -Mᵀ`, and the product of two
upper ones is the lower cross product, which by `Matrix.mulVec_cross_add_cross_mulVec` forces
`trace M = 0`. So `E = slDerivation M`, and `TauCeti.Octonion.tripleEquivDerivationLieAlgebra`
packages `TauCeti.Octonion.derivationOfTriple` as a linear equivalence.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.Octonion.imaginaryLieSubmodule`: the imaginary octonions as a Lie submodule of `𝕆` over
  `Der 𝕆`, so that `Im 𝕆` is a representation of `Der 𝕆`.
* `TauCeti.Octonion.slDerivation`: the homomorphism of Lie algebras `𝔰𝔩₃ → Der 𝕆`, the
  differentiated action of `SL₃` on the vector entries of a Zorn vector matrix.
* `TauCeti.Octonion.upperDerivation` and `TauCeti.Octonion.lowerDerivation`: the two
  three-parameter families of derivations attached to a vector.
* `TauCeti.Octonion.derivationOfTriple`: the three families assembled into one linear map out of
  `𝔰𝔩₃ × R³ × R³`.
* `TauCeti.Octonion.slOfVectors`: the trace-zero matrix through which an upper and a lower vector
  derivation bracket back into `𝔰𝔩₃`.
* `TauCeti.Octonion.tripleEquivDerivationLieAlgebra`: the linear equivalence
  `𝔰𝔩₃ × R³ × R³ ≃ Der 𝕆` given by the three families.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Octonion.trace_derivation_apply_eq_zero`: a derivation of `𝕆` has values of trace `0`, so
  (`TauCeti.Octonion.derivation_apply_mem_imaginary`) its image lies in the imaginary octonions.
* `TauCeti.Octonion.derivation_apply_conj`: a derivation commutes with conjugation.
* `TauCeti.Octonion.polar_derivation_apply_self_eq_zero` and
  `TauCeti.Octonion.polar_derivation_apply_left_eq_neg`: a derivation is **skew** for the symmetric
  bilinear form of the norm, `⟨D x, y⟩ = -⟨x, D y⟩`;
  `TauCeti.Octonion.associated_derivation_add_eq_zero` is the same statement written with
  `QuadraticMap.associated`, half the polar form.
* `TauCeti.Octonion.derivationLieAlgebra_le_skewAdjointLieSubalgebra`: `Der 𝕆 ≤ 𝔰𝔬(N)`, the
  skewness as an inclusion of Lie subalgebras of `Module.End R 𝕆`.
* `TauCeti.Octonion.isFaithful_imaginaryLieSubmodule`: `Der 𝕆` acts faithfully on `Im 𝕆` over
  every commutative ring; `TauCeti.Octonion.instIsFaithfulImaginaryLieSubmodule` is its instance
  form.
* `TauCeti.Octonion.lie_slDerivation_upperDerivation`,
  `TauCeti.Octonion.lie_slDerivation_lowerDerivation`,
  `TauCeti.Octonion.lie_upperDerivation_upperDerivation`,
  `TauCeti.Octonion.lie_lowerDerivation_lowerDerivation` and
  `TauCeti.Octonion.lie_upperDerivation_lowerDerivation`: the brackets of the three families with
  one another, the relations of the `ℤ/3`-grading.
* `TauCeti.Octonion.derivationOfTriple_injective`: the fourteen parameters are independent.
  In particular `Der 𝕆` is not the zero Lie algebra
  (`TauCeti.Octonion.instNontrivialDerivationLieAlgebra`), so none of the above is vacuous.
* `TauCeti.Octonion.derivationOfTriple_surjective`: every derivation of `𝕆` is in the
  fourteen-parameter family, over any commutative ring.
* `TauCeti.Octonion.finrank_derivationLieAlgebra`: **`finrank (Der 𝕆) = 14`**, the dimension of
  `G₂`, over any commutative ring with the strong rank condition; `Der 𝕆` is moreover free and
  finite as a module.

## Implementation notes

Everything is stated over a commutative ring, except
`TauCeti.Octonion.associated_derivation_add_eq_zero`, which asks for an invertible `2` because
`QuadraticMap.associated` does. The rank count `finrank (Der 𝕆) = 14` asks in addition for the
strong rank condition. Faithfulness needs no further hypothesis on the base ring: the imaginary
vector matrices generate the diagonal idempotent by multiplication. In characteristic `2`, the
imaginary octonions contain the unit, so its line is a trivial subrepresentation; this obstructs
irreducibility but does not affect faithfulness.

The two coordinate extractions the argument needs — reading the `a` and `b` entries of an equation
between multiples of `⟨1, 0, 0, 0⟩` and of `1` — are isolated in a private lemma, so none of the
public skewness statements is about entries of a vector matrix.

Derivations are taken in the bundled form `D : TauCeti.derivationLieAlgebra R (Octonion R)` of
`TauCeti/Algebra/Lie/Derivation/Basic.lean`, and are applied through the coercion
`(D : Module.End R (Octonion R))`, which is the simp-normal form of their action there.

/-- **A derivation negates conjugated inputs.** It kills `1` and conjugation is the reflection
`x ↦ tr x · 1 - x`, so `D (conj x) = -D x`. Once the values of `D` are known to have vanishing
trace this
upgrades to `TauCeti.Octonion.derivation_apply_conj`, the statement that `D` commutes with
conjugation; that is the form to use, and this one is what proves it. -/

Applying `D` to the rank-two equation `x² = tr x · x - N x · 1` gives
`D x · x + x · D x = tr x · D x`,
and the polarization `x * conj y + y * conj x = ⟨x, y⟩ · 1` of the norm at `y = D x`, with both
conjugates
rewritten as reflections in the trace, gives
`tr (D x) · x + tr x · D x - (x · D x + D x · x) = ⟨x, D x⟩ · 1`. Substituting the first into the
second is the statement. -/

/-- **A derivation of `𝕆` has values of trace `0`.**

Evaluating the key identity `tr (D x) · x = ⟨x, D x⟩ · 1` at the diagonal idempotent `e` gives
`tr (D e) = 0`, because the two sides have different second diagonal entries; polarizing the
identity and putting `e` in the second slot then gives `tr (D x) · e = ⟨x, D e⟩ + ⟨e, D x⟩ · 1` for
arbitrary `x`, and the same entry comparison finishes. Not a `simp` lemma, because
`TauCeti.Octonion.trace_apply` already takes its left-hand side apart. -/

/-! ### The two vector families of derivations -/

section Vector

/- The vector `simp` set, as in `TauCeti/Algebra/Octonion/Basic.lean`: dot and cross products are
pushed through the linear combinations that make up an entry of a product, dot products are
normalised by commutativity, and the compound products that survive are reduced by Mathlib's own
identities -- `Matrix.cross_dot_cross` for a dot product of two cross products,
`Matrix.cross_cross_eq_smul_sub_smul` and its primed form for an iterated one. What is left is a
polynomial in the dot products, which `ring` closes, or a linear combination of the entries and
their cross products, which `module` closes; the triple products that neither identity reaches are
rotated by `Matrix.triple_product_permutation` and `Matrix.cross_anticomm`. -/
