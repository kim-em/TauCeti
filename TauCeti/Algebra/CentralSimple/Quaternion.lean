# Splitting the real quaternions

The real quaternions `ℍ[ℝ]` are a central division algebra of dimension `4` over `ℝ`, hence a
central simple `ℝ`-algebra of degree `2`. They are not a matrix algebra over `ℝ`, but they become
one in two ways: after tensoring with their opposite, or with themselves, over `ℝ`, and after
extending scalars to `ℂ`.

For the first, this file runs the opposite isomorphism of
`TauCeti/Algebra/CentralSimple/Opposite.lean` on `ℍ[ℝ]`, in the two forms

`ℍ[ℝ] ⊗[ℝ] ℍ[ℝ]ᵐᵒᵖ ≃ₐ[ℝ] Matrix (Fin 4) (Fin 4) ℝ`  and
`ℍ[ℝ] ⊗[ℝ] ℍ[ℝ] ≃ₐ[ℝ] Matrix (Fin 4) (Fin 4) ℝ`.

The tensor-square form follows from the opposite form because quaternion conjugation is an
`ℝ`-algebra isomorphism `ℍ[ℝ] ≃ₐ[ℝ] ℍ[ℝ]ᵐᵒᵖ` (Mathlib's `Quaternion.starAe`): the quaternions are
their own opposite.

For the second, `ℂ` is algebraically closed, so it splits `ℍ[ℝ]` already at its degree:
`ℂ ⊗[ℝ] ℍ[ℝ] ≃ₐ[ℂ] Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℂ`. That is, the complexification of the quaternions is
the full matrix algebra `M₂(ℂ)`.

Nothing below is a statement about `BrauerGroup ℝ`: the main results are algebra isomorphisms, and
the two examples closing the file are a degree computation and a nonexistence statement.
Informally, the tensor-square isomorphisms exhibit the Brauer class of `ℍ[ℝ]` as **self-inverse**;
that the class is moreover not the identity, so that its order is exactly `2`, is
`TauCeti.Quaternion.orderOf_mk_eq_two` in `TauCeti/Algebra/BrauerGroup/Quaternion.lean`. Saying that
`BrauerGroup ℝ ≃ ℤ/2` is a further and independent matter, needing the classification of real
division algebras to know the class generates; that is
`TauCeti.Quaternion.brauerGroupMulEquiv` in `TauCeti/Algebra/BrauerGroup/Real.lean`.

The matrix size is `4` and not `2`: it is the **dimension** `Module.finrank ℝ ℍ[ℝ] = 4` of the
algebra, not its degree `TauCeti.Algebra.deg ℝ ℍ[ℝ] = 2`. Squaring the degree is exactly what taking
the tensor product with the opposite algebra does, and the degree example at the end of the file
checks it.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Quaternion.tensorOpAlgEquivMatrix`:
  `ℍ[ℝ] ⊗[ℝ] ℍ[ℝ]ᵐᵒᵖ ≃ₐ[ℝ] Matrix (Fin 4) (Fin 4) ℝ`.
* `TauCeti.Quaternion.tensorSelfAlgEquivMatrix`: `ℍ[ℝ] ⊗[ℝ] ℍ[ℝ] ≃ₐ[ℝ] Matrix (Fin 4) (Fin 4) ℝ`,
  the splitting of the tensor square.
* `TauCeti.Quaternion.complexTensorAlgEquivMatrix`:
  `ℂ ⊗[ℝ] ℍ[ℝ] ≃ₐ[ℂ] Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℂ`, the splitting of `ℍ[ℝ]` by `ℂ` at its degree.

/-- **`ℍ[ℝ] ⊗[ℝ] ℍ[ℝ]ᵐᵒᵖ ≃ₐ[ℝ] Matrix (Fin 4) (Fin 4) ℝ`**: the opposite isomorphism at the real
quaternions. `TauCeti.Algebra.tensorOpAlgEquivMatrix` asks for `IsAzumaya ℝ ℍ[ℝ]`, which
`TauCeti.IsSimpleRing.isAzumaya` supplies and which is not an instance, so it is installed by hand;
its own three hypotheses are found by instance search -- `Algebra.IsCentral ℝ ℍ[ℝ]` from
`TauCeti.Quaternion.instIsCentral`, `IsSimpleRing ℍ[ℝ]` because a division ring is simple, and
`FiniteDimensional ℝ ℍ[ℝ]` -- so beyond it only the dimension `Quaternion.finrank_eq_four` has to be
supplied. -/

isomorphism `ℍ[ℝ] ≃ₐ[ℝ] ℍ[ℝ]ᵐᵒᵖ` (`Quaternion.starAe`), so the tensor square of `ℍ[ℝ]` is its tensor
product with its own opposite, which `TauCeti.Quaternion.tensorOpAlgEquivMatrix` splits.

In Brauer-group language this exhibits the class of `ℍ[ℝ]` as its own inverse. Whether that class is
the identity is a separate question, not settled by this isomorphism; see the module docstring. -/

at their degree `2`, so after extending scalars to `ℂ` the quaternions become the full matrix

/-- The tensor square of the real quaternions has degree `4`, by the multiplicativity of the degree
and `TauCeti.Algebra.deg ℝ ℍ[ℝ] = 2`. This is an independent check on the matrix size in
`TauCeti.Quaternion.tensorSelfAlgEquivMatrix`: `4` really is `2 · 2`, and not the degree `2` of
either factor. A caller wanting the numeral gets it the same way, from
`TauCeti.Algebra.deg_tensorProduct`, so this is an example rather than a lemma. -/

    Algebra.deg_eq_of_finrank_eq_sq (by rw [_root_.Quaternion.finrank_eq_four]; norm_num)
  rw [Algebra.deg_tensorProduct, h]

/-- The tensor square is split, but `ℍ[ℝ]` itself is not: the only matrix algebra over `ℝ` of
dimension `4` is `Matrix (Fin 2) (Fin 2) ℝ`, and `ℍ[ℝ]` is a division algebra, so no isomorphism
exists. It is this nonsplitting that makes the self-inverse class of `ℍ[ℝ]` different from the
identity, and so of order exactly `2` (`TauCeti.Quaternion.orderOf_mk_eq_two`). -/
