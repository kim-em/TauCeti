# Polynomials from a list of coefficients, and division by a monic polynomial

`Polynomial` is a `Finsupp`, so none of its arithmetic reduces in the kernel.  A polynomial
presented instead by the list of its coefficients does compute, and this file sets up the
translation, together with the one algorithm a computation on such lists needs: division by a
monic polynomial.

`TauCeti.Polynomial.ofCoeffList l` is the polynomial whose coefficients are the entries of `l`,
read from the highest degree down, so that it inverts Mathlib's `Polynomial.coeffList`
(`TauCeti.Polynomial.coeffList_ofCoeffList` and `TauCeti.Polynomial.ofCoeffList_coeffList`).  Its
defining recursion is Horner's, `ofCoeffList (l ++ [a]) = ofCoeffList l * X + C a`, and every proof
below runs along it.  It is a `noncomputable` specification map: the *lists* are what compute.

`TauCeti.Polynomial.mulCoeffList` multiplies two such lists by convolving their coefficients, and
`TauCeti.Polynomial.ofCoeffList_mulCoeffList` identifies the result with the product polynomial.

`TauCeti.Polynomial.divModByMonicList t l` is long division of `ofCoeffList l` by the monic
polynomial `X ^ t.length + ofCoeffList t`, carried out as the usual synthetic division: a window of
`t.length` remainder coefficients is carried along the dividend, and at each step the coefficient
shifted out of the window is the next quotient coefficient and is used to clear the window against
the divisor.  Presenting the divisor by the list `t` of the coefficients *below* its leading one
makes it monic by construction, so `TauCeti.Polynomial.ofCoeffList_divByMonicList` and
`TauCeti.Polynomial.ofCoeffList_modByMonicList`, which identify the two outputs with Mathlib's `/ₘ`
and `%ₘ`, need no hypotheses at all.  Like Mathlib's `/ₘ` and `%ₘ`, the division needs no
commutativity: the window is cleared by `x - y * c`, with the quotient coefficient `c` on the
right, which is what matches Mathlib's convention `f = g * q + r` with the divisor on the left.

The division definitions are `@[expose]`d, since a consumer computing with them in another module
reduces them in the kernel.
