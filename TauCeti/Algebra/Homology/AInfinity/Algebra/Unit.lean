# Strict units for `A∞` algebras

This file records strict units for the uncurved `A∞` algebras of
`TauCeti.Algebra.Homology.AInfinity.Algebra`.  A strict unit is a degree-zero cycle whose binary
operation is a two-sided unit and whose other operations vanish whenever one input is the unit.
The higher-operation condition is stated on arbitrary input families, so it can be used directly
with the unsuspended operations without exposing the bar coderivation.

The uniqueness theorem and the elimination lemmas are the basic interface used by the later
strictly unital morphism and augmentation constructions.

/-- A **strict unit** for an uncurved `A∞` algebra in the Keller convention.

The unit has degree zero, is closed under `m₁`, and is a two-sided unit for `m₂`.  Every operation
of arity other than two vanishes as soon as one of its inputs is the unit.  In particular, the
condition includes arity zero, although that case is vacuous because the input family is empty;
curvature is already excluded by `AInfinityAlgebra.m_zero`. -/
