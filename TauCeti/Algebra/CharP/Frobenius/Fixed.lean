# The subring and subfield fixed by an iterated Frobenius

Let `A` be a commutative ring of exponential characteristic `p` and let `q = p ^ n`. The elements
of `A` satisfying `a ^ q = a` are the equalizer of the ring homomorphism `iterateFrobenius A p n`
and the identity, hence a subring: this file names it `TauCeti.frobeniusFixedSubring` and records
its elementary properties. Over a field the equalizer is closed under inverses as well, giving
`TauCeti.frobeniusFixedSubfield`.

For `p` prime, `0 < n` and `A` an algebraic closure of `ZMod p` this subring is the field of `q`
elements sitting inside `A`, which is why the construction is the ring-theoretic half of "the fixed
points of the `q`-power Frobenius are the `𝔽_q`-points"; at `n = 0` it is instead the whole of `A`,
since `q = 1`. Nothing about finiteness or about the field of `q` elements is proved here: the
subring statements below are about an arbitrary commutative ring of exponential characteristic `p`
and the subfield ones about an arbitrary field of exponential characteristic `p`, and Mathlib's
`iterateFrobenius` supplies every proof.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.frobeniusFixedSubring`: the subring of elements fixed by the `p ^ n`-power Frobenius.
* `TauCeti.frobeniusFixedSubfield`: the same elements of a field, as a subfield.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.mem_frobeniusFixedSubring`: membership is the equation `a ^ p ^ n = a`.
* `TauCeti.mem_frobeniusFixedSubring_mul_iff_iterate_eq`: at exponent `m * k`, membership is being
  fixed by the `k`-th iterate of the `p ^ m`-power Frobenius.
* `TauCeti.frobeniusFixedSubring_zero` and `TauCeti.frobeniusFixedSubfield_zero`: the zeroth
  iterate fixes everything.
* `TauCeti.frobeniusFixedSubring_le_of_dvd` and `TauCeti.frobeniusFixedSubfield_le_of_dvd`: the
  fixed subrings and subfields grow along divisibility of the exponent, the inclusion
  `𝔽_{p ^ m} ⊆ 𝔽_{p ^ k}` in the motivating case.
* `TauCeti.map_le_frobeniusFixedSubring`: a ring homomorphism carries fixed elements to fixed
  elements.

## References

Mathlib's `Mathlib/Algebra/CharP/Frobenius.lean` supplies the Frobenius endomorphisms and their
iteration and naturality laws. The fixed subring and subfield use Mathlib's `RingHom.eqLocus` and
`RingHom.eqLocusField` equalizer constructions.

variable (A : Type*) [CommRing A] (p n : ℕ) [ExpChar A p]

/-- The subring of elements of `A` fixed by the `p ^ n`-power Frobenius, that is, the solutions of
`a ^ p ^ n = a`. It is the equalizer of `iterateFrobenius A p n` with the identity.

When `p` is prime, `0 < n` and `A` is an algebraic closure of `ZMod p` this is the subring of
`p ^ n` elements, but nothing of the sort is asserted here: `A` is an arbitrary commutative ring of
exponential characteristic `p`, and for `p = 1` — that is, in characteristic zero — or for `n = 0`
the whole of `A` is fixed. -/

/-- The Frobenius-fixed subring is again of exponential characteristic `p`, so it is itself a
legitimate value algebra for the Frobenius: `iterateFrobenius` and everything built on it apply to
it. Mathlib has this for a `Subfield` (`Subfield.expChar`) but not for a `Subring`. -/
