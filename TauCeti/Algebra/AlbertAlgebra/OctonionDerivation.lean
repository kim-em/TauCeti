# Octonion derivations act on the split Albert algebra

`F₄` is the derivation algebra of the split Albert algebra `J = H₃(𝕆)` and `G₂` is the derivation
algebra of the split octonions, so the inclusion `G₂ ↪ F₄` ought to be visible before either
algebra is identified with its Serre-construction namesake. It is: a derivation `D` of `𝕆` applied
to each off-diagonal entry of a Hermitian matrix, and zero on the scalar diagonal, is a derivation
of `J`.

Writing a Hermitian matrix as its scalar diagonal `d` together with its three octonion entries `x`,
the symmetrized product `A ∘ B = ½ (A B + B A)` of `TauCeti/Algebra/AlbertAlgebra/Basic.lean` has
diagonal `d i e i + β (x (i + 1)) (y (i + 1)) + β (x (i + 2)) (y (i + 2))`, for `β` the symmetric
bilinear form of the split-octonion norm, and entries
`½ ((d (i + 1) + d (i + 2)) • y i + (e (i + 1) + e (i + 2)) • x i)` corrected by the conjugate of
`½ (x (i + 1) * y (i + 2) + y (i + 1) * x (i + 2))`. Both halves of the Leibniz rule are then
octonion facts already in `TauCeti/Algebra/Octonion/Derivation.lean`: on the diagonal the two
surviving terms are `β (D x) y + β x (D y)`, which vanishes because a derivation is **skew** for
the norm form (`TauCeti.Octonion.associated_derivation_add_eq_zero`), and off it the entries are
differentiated by the octonion Leibniz rule together with the fact that a derivation **commutes
with conjugation** (`TauCeti.Octonion.derivation_apply_conj`).

The assignment is a homomorphism of Lie algebras `Der 𝕆 →ₗ⁅R⁆ Der J`, because applying a derivation
entrywise is multiplicative for the composition of endomorphisms, and it is injective, because a
single off-diagonal slot already sees all of `𝕆`. Over a field in which `2` is invertible the
fourteen independent derivations of `𝕆` counted by
`TauCeti.Octonion.finrank_derivationLieAlgebra` therefore give
`14 ≤ finrank (Der J)`, the first instalment of the dimension `52` of `F₄`.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.AlbertAlgebra.offDiagMap`: a linear endomorphism of `𝕆` acting on `H₃(𝕆)` by its
  off-diagonal entries, as a linear map `End 𝕆 →ₗ[R] End H₃(𝕆)`.
* `TauCeti.AlbertAlgebra.ofOctonionDerivation`: the induced homomorphism of Lie algebras
  `Der 𝕆 →ₗ⁅R⁆ Der H₃(𝕆)`, the inclusion `G₂ ↪ F₄` in derivation form.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.AlbertAlgebra.offDiagMap_mem_derivationLieAlgebra`: the entrywise action of a derivation
  of `𝕆` is a derivation of `H₃(𝕆)`.
* `TauCeti.AlbertAlgebra.offDiagMap_apply_diagIdempotent` and
  `TauCeti.AlbertAlgebra.offDiagMap_apply_offDiagSingle`: the action kills the diagonal frame and
  sends the `j`-th off-diagonal slot `Fⱼ(a)` to `Fⱼ(f a)`.
* `TauCeti.AlbertAlgebra.ofOctonionDerivation_injective`: the inclusion is injective, and
  `TauCeti.AlbertAlgebra.fourteen_le_finrank_derivationLieAlgebra`: hence `14 ≤ finrank (Der J)`
  over a field in which `2` is invertible.

## Implementation notes

The entrywise action itself uses nothing but the module structures, so it is stated over a
commutative semiring; a commutative ring and an invertible `2` are asked for only from the point
where the symmetrized product enters, as they must be for that product to exist at all, and the
base is a field only in the final rank bound. (A commutative semiring and not a bare one: the
assignment is an `R`-linear map between modules of `R`-linear endomorphisms, which needs `R` to
commute with itself.)

`TauCeti.AlbertAlgebra.offDiagMap` is built on bare endomorphisms rather than on derivations, so
that its additivity, its homogeneity and its multiplicativity for composition are available before
any Leibniz rule is proved; `TauCeti.AlbertAlgebra.ofOctonionDerivation` is then assembled from
those three facts with no further computation. The skewness of a derivation for the norm form is
available both as a statement about `QuadraticMap.polar` and, in the half of it that the Hermitian
product is written with, as `TauCeti.Octonion.associated_derivation_add_eq_zero`; it is the latter
that the Leibniz rule on the diagonal consumes.

## References

* `TauCeti/Algebra/Octonion/Derivation.lean`, which supplies both octonion inputs, and
  `TauCeti/Algebra/AlbertAlgebra/Derivation.lean`, which studies `Der H₃(𝕆)` from the other side,
  through the Peirce calculus of the diagonal frame.
* T. A. Springer and F. D. Veldkamp, *Octonions, Jordan Algebras and Exceptional Groups*, §5.3,
  where `Der H₃(𝕆)` is decomposed as `Der 𝕆` plus the traceless anti-Hermitian matrices; only the
  first summand, and so only the bound `14 ≤ finrank`, is built here.
