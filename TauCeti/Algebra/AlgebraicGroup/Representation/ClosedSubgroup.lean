# Faithful representations of closed subgroups

Let `M` be a finite free comodule over a commutative Hopf algebra `H`. Corestricting its coaction
along a surjective bialgebra morphism `H ⟶ K` restricts the corresponding representation to the
closed subgroup represented by `K`. Its coordinate morphism is the composite

```text
O(GL(M)) ⟶ H ⟶ K.
```

Consequently a faithful representation stays faithful after restriction to a closed subgroup. If
that restricted representation is trivial, faithfulness forces the subgroup itself to be the
identity subgroup. The final Hopf-ideal form says that a closed subgroup acting trivially through
a faithful ambient representation is cut out by the augmentation ideal.

This is the kernel-elimination input for the direct proof that `GLₙ` is reductive. For a connected
normal smooth unipotent closed subgroup, the normal-invariants argument makes its fixed vectors an
ambient subrepresentation; simplicity of the standard representation makes every vector fixed,
and the result here then identifies the subgroup with the identity.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.Comodule.augmentation_eq_bot_of_isFaithful_of_coact_eq_tmul_one`: a Hopf algebra with
  a faithful trivial representation is trivial.
* `TauCeti.Comodule.eq_augmentation_of_isFaithful_of_quotient_coact_eq_tmul_one`: a closed
  subgroup acting trivially in a faithful representation is the identity subgroup.

## References

* J. S. Milne, *Algebraic Groups* (2017), §4.a and §5.
* T. A. Springer, *Linear Algebraic Groups*, §2.2.

This advances the worked-example target `GLₙ` is reductive in Layer 6 of the ReductiveGroups
roadmap. It supplies the faithful-representation step used after normal-subgroup invariants and
Kolchin's fixed-vector theorem.
