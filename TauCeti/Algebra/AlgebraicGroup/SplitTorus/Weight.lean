# Weights of the split torus as characters

The character lattice of the rank-`σ` split torus is `σ →₀ ℤ`, while a weight of a
representation written in a basis is an exponent vector `μ : σ → ℤ`, the datum
`TauCeti.torusCharacter` evaluates at a point. For finite `σ` these are the same thing, and this
file records the translation:

* `TauCeti.SplitTorus.weightCharacter` turns an exponent vector into a character;
* `TauCeti.SplitTorus.charOfPoint_weightCharacter` says that evaluating that character at a point
  of the torus gives the monomial `∏ j, s j ^ μ j` in the coordinates `s` of the point;
* `TauCeti.SplitTorus.closure_range_weightCharacter_eq_top_iff` says that a family of weights
  generates the character group exactly when it spans the lattice of exponent vectors.

The last statement is the hypothesis under which a diagonal representation with these weights is
faithful, so it is what turns a spanning set of weights into a closed immersion of the torus.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.SplitTorus.weightCharacter`: the character of `𝔾ₘ^σ` with a prescribed exponent
  vector.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.SplitTorus.apply_weightCharacter`: evaluation of a weight character under an
  arbitrary multiplicative character.
* `TauCeti.SplitTorus.charOfPoint_weightCharacter`: the value of a weight character at a point.
* `TauCeti.SplitTorus.closure_range_weightCharacter_eq_top_iff`: weights generate the character
  group exactly when they span the lattice of exponent vectors.
