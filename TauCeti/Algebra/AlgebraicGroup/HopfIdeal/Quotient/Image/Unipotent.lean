# Unipotence of affine group images

For a morphism `f : H ⟶ K` of commutative Hopf algebras, its scheme-theoretic image has coordinate
algebra
`CommHopfAlgCat.image f = H / ker f`; finite type of `K` makes the canonical inclusion
`CommHopfAlgCat.image f ⟶ K` finite type. If this inclusion is faithfully flat, every
algebraically closed point of the image lifts to a point of `Spec K`.

There are two ways to descend unipotence from `Spec K` to the image. A faithfully flat inclusion
lifts every geometric point of the image to the source. More directly, when `K` is reduced and
finite type, injectivity of the canonical inclusion lets the general reduced descent theorem
apply to every scheme-theoretic image of a smooth unipotent affine group.

## Main declaration

* `TauCeti.geometricallyUnipotentPointsCommHopfAlgProperty.image_of_reduced`: the image of a
  reduced finite-type geometrically unipotent affine group is geometrically unipotent.
* `TauCeti.geometricallyUnipotentPointsCommHopfAlgProperty.image_of_faithfullyFlat`: a
  faithfully flat finite-type affine group image has only unipotent geometric points when its
  source does.

## References

* A. Borel, *Linear Algebraic Groups*, Proposition 14.4, for the unipotent-radical application.

This is the image-unipotence step for Layer 5, "The unipotent radical", of the ReductiveGroups
roadmap. In particular, it supplies the remaining geometric-unipotence input in the binary-product
closure of connected normal smooth unipotent subgroup schemes.

/-- The scheme-theoretic image of a finite-type geometrically unipotent affine group is
geometrically unipotent when the source-to-image morphism is faithfully flat.

The finite-type hypothesis on `K` makes the canonical inclusion of the image coordinate algebra
into `K` a finite-type algebra map. Faithful flatness then lifts every algebraic-closure-valued
point of the image to a point of `K`, whose unipotence descends by precomposition. -/
