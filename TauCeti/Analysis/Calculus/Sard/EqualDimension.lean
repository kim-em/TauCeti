# Sard's lemma in equal dimensions

This file proves the equal-dimensional case of Sard's theorem for maps between two possibly
different finite-dimensional real normed spaces.  A differentiable map sends any set on which its
derivative is nowhere surjective to a set of additive Haar measure zero.  In particular, the
critical values of a differentiable map between spaces of equal dimension have measure zero, and
the regular values are dense.

Mathlib proves the corresponding result for an endomorphism of one normed space in
`addHaar_image_eq_zero_of_det_fderivWithin_eq_zero`.  We transport the codomain across a continuous
linear equivalence and use uniqueness of additive Haar measure to return to the original codomain.
This is the first, equal-dimensional slice of finite-dimensional Sard required by Lane F0 of the
analytic Heegaard Floer roadmap.  The general Morse--Sard theorem additionally needs the
higher-regularity argument when the dimensions differ.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.addHaar_image_eq_zero_of_not_surjective_fderivWithin`: a map between equal-dimensional
  spaces sends a set of nonsurjective derivative points to a null set.
* `Differentiable.addHaar_image_criticalPoints_eq_zero`: the critical values of a globally
  differentiable map between equal-dimensional spaces form a null set.
* `Differentiable.dense_compl_image_criticalPoints`: the regular values of such a map are
  dense.

The measure-theoretic input follows Sébastien Gouëzel's Mathlib formalization of the change of
variables theorem, itself based on Fremlin, *Measure Theory*, volume 2.

/-- **Sard's lemma in equal dimensions.** Let `E` and `F` be finite-dimensional real normed
spaces of equal dimension. If `f` is differentiable along `s` with derivative `f'`, and `f'` is
nowhere surjective on `s`, then `f '' s` has additive Haar measure zero in `F`.

Unlike the endomorphism version in Mathlib, the domain and codomain need not be the same normed
space and may carry unrelated norms and Haar measure normalizations. -/
