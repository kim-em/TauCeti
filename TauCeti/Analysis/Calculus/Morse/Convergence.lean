# Convergence of a negative gradient trajectory

A negative gradient trajectory `γ` of `f`, followed forward in time and never leaving a compact
set `K`, **converges** to a critical point of `f` provided that `f` has only finitely many critical
points in `K`:

`∃ p ∈ K, ∇ f p = 0 ∧ Tendsto γ atTop (𝓝 p)`.

This is the statement that makes the moduli spaces of the Morse complex — the trajectories running
from one critical point to another — well defined objects at all, and it is where Lane M of the
analytic Heegaard Floer roadmap turns the dynamical facts of
`TauCeti/Analysis/Calculus/Morse/GradientFlow.lean` into the beginnings of a chain complex.

Some hypothesis beyond compactness is needed to pin the limit down. For a merely smooth `f` a
negative gradient trajectory can spiral forever towards a circle of critical points, its ω-limit
set being the whole circle and the trajectory having no limit at all; for an analytic `f` this is
ruled out by Łojasiewicz's gradient inequality, and here it is ruled out by the Morse condition.
The theorem below therefore assumes that `f` has only **finitely many critical points** in `K`,
which is exactly what a Morse function on a compact set provides, by
`TauCeti.HasNondegenerateCriticalPointsOn.finite_setOfPred_fderiv_eq_zero`.

## The argument

The three steps are the classical ones (Audin--Damian, Chapter 2).

*The energy converges.* Along the trajectory `f` is antitone
(`TauCeti.IsIntegralCurveOn.antitoneOn_comp_neg_gradient`) and is bounded below on `K`, so
`f ∘ γ` has a limit.

*The gradient dies.* The trajectory is Lipschitz, with the bound on `‖∇ f‖` over `K` as its
constant, and `∇ f` is uniformly continuous on `K`; so if `‖∇ f (γ t)‖ ≥ ε` at some time `t`, the
same holds with `ε / 2` throughout a time interval `[t, t + δ]` whose length `δ` does not depend on
`t`. The energy identity `TauCeti.IsIntegralCurveOn.integral_norm_gradient_sq_eq_sub` then makes
`f` drop by at least `δ (ε / 2) ^ 2` across that interval — impossible infinitely often, since the
energy converges. Hence `∇ f (γ t) → 0`.

*The ω-limit set is a point.* Every cluster point of `γ` along `atTop` is therefore a critical
point in `K`, so the ω-limit set is finite; and it is preconnected, by
`TauCeti.isPreconnected_setOf_mapClusterPt_atTop`. A finite preconnected set is a single point
(`Set.Finite.isTotallyDisconnected`), and a map into a compact set with a unique cluster point
converges to it.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.IsIntegralCurveOn.exists_tendsto_comp_atTop`: the energy `f ∘ γ` converges.
* `TauCeti.IsIntegralCurveOn.tendsto_gradient_atTop`: the gradient along the trajectory tends
  to `0`.
* `TauCeti.IsIntegralCurveOn.gradient_eq_zero_of_mapClusterPt`: every point of the ω-limit set is
  a critical point.
* `TauCeti.IsIntegralCurveOn.exists_tendsto_atTop`: **a confined negative gradient trajectory
  converges to a critical point**, when the critical points in the confining compact set are
  finite in number.
* `TauCeti.IsIntegralCurveOn.exists_tendsto_atTop_of_hasNondegenerateCriticalPointsOn`: the Morse
  form of the same statement, where the finiteness comes from nondegeneracy.
* `TauCeti.IsIntegralCurveOn.exists_tendsto_atBot`: the corresponding backward-time statement.
* `TauCeti.IsIntegralCurveOn.exists_tendsto_atBot_of_hasNondegenerateCriticalPointsOn`: its Morse
  form, where finiteness follows from nondegeneracy.

/-- **Across a short interval the energy drops by at least `δ * (ε / 2) ^ 2`.** If `‖∇ f (γ t)‖`
is at least `ε` at a time `t ≥ 0`, and `δ` is short enough that the trajectory cannot move by `η`
in that time, then the modulus `hUC` keeps the gradient above `ε / 2` throughout `[t, t + δ]`, and
the energy identity turns that into the stated drop of `f`.

The bound is vacuous when `δ = 0`, which the hypotheses permit; the caller supplies a positive
`δ`. They do not permit `ε = 0`: `hUC` applied to `γ t` against itself forces `0 < ε`. -/

/-- **The gradient tends to zero along a confined negative gradient trajectory.**

The trajectory is Lipschitz and `∇ f` is uniformly continuous on the compact set it stays in, so a
time at which `‖∇ f (γ t)‖` is at least `ε` is the start of a time interval of a fixed length `δ`
on which it is at least `ε / 2`. Across such an interval the energy identity makes `f` drop by at
least `δ (ε / 2) ^ 2`; but the drops of `f` across intervals of fixed length tend to `0`, because
`f` converges along the trajectory. So the times at which `‖∇ f (γ t)‖ ≥ ε` are bounded. -/

/-! ### Convergence -/

/-- **A negative gradient trajectory that never leaves a compact set converges to a critical point
of `f` in it**, provided `f` has only finitely many critical points there.

Some such hypothesis is needed: a negative gradient trajectory can spiral forever towards a circle
of critical points and then have no limit, its ω-limit set being the whole circle. The finiteness
holds for a Morse function, which is
`TauCeti.IsIntegralCurveOn.exists_tendsto_atTop_of_hasNondegenerateCriticalPointsOn` below.

Nothing is claimed about the *rate* of convergence, nor about the backward limit: the reversed
curve `fun t ↦ γ (-t)` is a negative gradient trajectory of `-f`, so the backward limit is this
same theorem applied to `-f`, whose hypotheses have to be checked separately. -/
