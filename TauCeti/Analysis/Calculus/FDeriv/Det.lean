# The derivative of the determinant at the identity

The determinant of a square matrix over a complete nontrivially normed field is a polynomial in
the entries, hence differentiable, and its derivative at the identity matrix is the trace:

`det (1 + H) = 1 + trace H + o(H)`.

This is Jacobi's formula at the identity. Along a line it is the statement that the polynomial
`t ↦ det (1 + t • B)` has linear coefficient `trace B`, which Mathlib records as
`Matrix.derivative_det_one_add_X_smul`; differentiability of the determinant then upgrades that
directional derivative to the Fréchet derivative.

The normed structure on matrices is Mathlib's `L∞` operator norm, available through
`open scoped Matrix.Norms.Operator`; any other norm on the finite-dimensional space of matrices
gives the same derivative.

## Main results

* `Matrix.hasDerivAt_det_one_add_smul`: `t ↦ det (1 + t • B)` has derivative `trace B` at `0`.
* `Matrix.differentiable_det`: the determinant is differentiable.
* `Matrix.hasFDerivAt_det_one`: **the derivative of the determinant at the identity is the
  trace.**
