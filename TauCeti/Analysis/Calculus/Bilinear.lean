# Derivatives of maps built from a continuous bilinear map

The quadratic map `z ↦ B z z` attached to a continuous bilinear map `B : E →L[𝕜] E →L[𝕜] F` is
smooth, with derivative at `y` the polarization `B.flip y + B y` of `B` evaluated at `y`; since
that derivative is linear in `y`, the second derivative is the constant continuous linear map
`B.flip + B`. This is the derivative computation behind the local model of a nondegenerate
critical point, but it depends on nothing beyond the bilinear chain rule
`ContinuousLinearMap.hasStrictFDerivAt_of_bilinear` and the smoothness of bounded bilinear maps.

The same chain rule differentiates the pairing `y ↦ B (u y) (∂_w u y)` of a `C²` map `u` with one
of its directional derivatives, the one-form `x ↦ B x` pulled back along `u` and evaluated in the
direction `w`; its derivative involves the second derivative of `u`.

## Main results

* `ContinuousLinearMap.contDiff_apply_self`: `z ↦ B z z` is `C^n` for every `n`, and its
  corollary `ContinuousLinearMap.differentiable_apply_self`.
* `ContinuousLinearMap.hasStrictFDerivAt_apply_self`: `z ↦ B z z` is strictly
  differentiable at `y`, with derivative the polarization of `B` evaluated at `y`.
* `ContinuousLinearMap.hasFDerivAt_apply_self`, and its `fderiv` form
  `ContinuousLinearMap.fderiv_apply_self`.
* `ContinuousLinearMap.fderiv_fderiv_apply_self`: the second derivative of `z ↦ B z z` is
  the constant `B.flip + B`.
* `ContinuousLinearMap.hasFDerivAt_bilinear_fderiv_apply`: the derivative of
  `y ↦ B (u y) (∂_w u y)` at a point where `u` is `C²`.
* `ContinuousLinearMap.contDiff_precomp_comp`: the pullback `(v, w) ↦ B (L v) (L w)` of a
  continuous bilinear map `B` along a continuous linear map `L` depends smoothly on `(B, L)`.
