# Smoothness of the complemented-kernel implicit function theorem

Let `f : E → F` be a map between Banach spaces which is strictly differentiable at `a` with
surjective derivative `f'` whose kernel is complemented. Mathlib's
`HasStrictFDerivAt.implicitToOpenPartialHomeomorphOfComplemented` straightens `f` near `a`: it is
the homeomorphism `x ↦ (f x, P (x - a))` onto a neighbourhood of `(f a, 0)` in `F × ker f'`, where
`P` is the continuous projection onto `ker f'` chosen by the complementation hypothesis, and its
inverse restricted to the slice `{f a} × ker f'` is the implicit function of `f`.

Mathlib records the strict differentiability of that homeomorphism and of its inverse. This file
adds the `C^n` statements, obtained from Mathlib's smooth inverse theorem for an
`OpenPartialHomeomorph`, `OpenPartialHomeomorph.contDiffAt_symm`, and the value of the inverse
homeomorphism at `(f a, 0)`.

Smoothness of the inverse at a point of the target needs the derivative of the coordinate map to
be invertible there. At the base point that is the hypothesis of the theorem; away from it, it is
supplied by `TauCeti.Analysis.Calculus.InverseFunctionTheorem`, on the open neighbourhood
`HasStrictFDerivAt.implicitCoordSource` of the base point that the inverse function theorem itself
produced. So the implicit function is `C^n` on a whole neighbourhood of the origin of the slice,
not only at the origin: enough to compare two implicit-function charts smoothly, which is what a
manifold structure on a level set asks for.

Mathlib's `ImplicitFunctionData.contDiffAt_implicitFunction` is a `C^n` implicit function theorem
for the same data. It is not usable here: it is stated over `[RCLike 𝕜]` and assumes `n ≠ 0`,
whereas the results below hold over an arbitrary `[NontriviallyNormedField K]` — the generality in
which the underlying homeomorphism, and its consumer `TauCeti.levelSetChart`, are stated — and for
every `n : ℕ∞ω`. Consumers that are content with `RCLike` scalars and `n ≠ 0` should prefer
Mathlib's lemma.

## Main results

* `HasStrictFDerivAt.implicitToOpenPartialHomeomorphOfComplemented_symm_self`: the inverse
  homeomorphism sends `(f a, 0)` back to the base point `a`.
* `HasStrictFDerivAt.contDiffAt_implicitToOpenPartialHomeomorphOfComplemented`: the
  complemented-kernel implicit-function homeomorphism is as smooth as the equation, at every point
  where the equation is.
* `HasStrictFDerivAt.contDiffAt_implicitToOpenPartialHomeomorphOfComplemented_symm`: so is its
  inverse, at the image `(f a, 0)` of the base point.
* `HasStrictFDerivAt.eventually_implicitFunctionOfComplemented_eq`: near `0`, Mathlib's two
  spellings of the implicit function agree.
* `ContinuousLinearMap.implicitCoordEquiv`: the derivative `x ↦ (f' x, P x)` of the coordinate
  map, as a continuous linear equivalence.
* `HasStrictFDerivAt.implicitCoordSource`: an open neighbourhood of the base point on which the
  derivative of the coordinate map stays invertible.
* `HasStrictFDerivAt.contDiffAt_implicitToOpenPartialHomeomorphOfComplemented_symm_of_mem`: the
  inverse homeomorphism is `C^n` at every point of the target coming from that neighbourhood.
* `HasStrictFDerivAt.surjective_of_mem_implicitCoordSource`: the derivative of the equation stays
  surjective on that neighbourhood.
* `HasStrictFDerivAt.exists_isSliceChart_preimage_zero`: near a point where a `C^n` map has
  surjective derivative with complemented kernel, a `C^n` ambient chart flattens its zero set onto
  that kernel.

/- Mathlib names the complemented-kernel implicit function twice, once as
`HasStrictFDerivAt.implicitFunctionOfComplemented` and once as the inverse of
`HasStrictFDerivAt.implicitToOpenPartialHomeomorphOfComplemented`. The two are equal by
definition, but neither definition is `@[expose]`d, so downstream they can only be identified
through Mathlib's own API, `HasStrictFDerivAt.eq_implicitFunctionOfComplemented`; that lemma is
itself eventual, which is why the statement below is too. -/
