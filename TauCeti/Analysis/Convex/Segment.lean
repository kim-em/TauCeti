# Affine segments and membership criteria

Mathlib describes membership in a segment through the ray predicate `SameRay` by
`mem_segment_iff_sameRay`: `x ∈ [y -[𝕜] z] ↔ SameRay 𝕜 (x - y) (z - x)`. That form is symmetric in
the two endpoints, and the differences `x - y`, `z - x` are exactly what a *metric* consumer does
not want: such a consumer holds a point `m` and an endpoint `w`, and asks whether `m` lies on the
segment `[0, w]` in terms of the two data it can measure — the direction of `m` against `w`, and
the two norms. This file supplies that reading, together with its mirror in which the origin sits
in the *middle* of the segment rather than at an end, and the inner-product form of both.

Each criterion is stated at the generality its proof uses. The origin-at-an-end one compares two
norms, and is stated for a real normed space; the inner-product forms replace `SameRay` by the
equality case of the Cauchy--Schwarz inequality, and are stated for a real inner product space.

The bridge between the ray form and the inner-product forms is Mathlib's pair
`sameRay_iff_norm_smul_eq : SameRay ℝ x y ↔ ‖x‖ • y = ‖y‖ • x` and
`inner_eq_norm_mul_iff_real : ⟪x, y⟫_ℝ = ‖x‖ * ‖y‖ ↔ ‖y‖ • x = ‖x‖ • y`, used directly: together
they say that two vectors lie on a common ray exactly when Cauchy--Schwarz is an equality for them.
No strict convexity is involved: the alternative route through `sameRay_iff_norm_add` would need a
`StrictConvexSpace ℝ E` instance, whereas `sameRay_iff_norm_smul_eq` and
`inner_eq_norm_mul_iff_real` hold in any normed, respectively inner product, space.

The clamped affine segment `Set.convexSegment` joins two points of any convex set, with no
topology or norm required. It agrees with the affine line map on `[0, 1]` and is constant outside
that interval. Its smoothness in convex open subsets is developed in
`TauCeti/Geometry/Manifold/ContMDiff/Subtype.lean`, and its Riemannian length in
`TauCeti/Geometry/Manifold/Riemannian/Convex.lean`.

The affine half-open segment result is also recorded here: in an additive commutative group with a
module structure over a linear ordered field, it identifies the image of a scalar interval under
an affine parametrization with a segment whose terminal endpoint is removed.

## Main results

* `Set.convexSegment` — an affine segment in a convex set, clamped to `[0, 1]`.
* `TauCeti.mem_segment_zero_left_iff_sameRay_and_norm_le` —
  `m ∈ [0 -[ℝ] w] ↔ SameRay ℝ m w ∧ ‖m‖ ≤ ‖w‖`. Both conjuncts are needed.
* `TauCeti.eq_of_mem_segment_zero_left_of_norm_eq` — the norm separates the points of `[0, w]`.
* `TauCeti.mem_segment_zero_left_iff_real_inner_eq_norm_mul_and_norm_le` and
  `TauCeti.zero_mem_segment_iff_real_inner_eq_neg_norm_mul` — the two criteria in a real inner
  product space.
* `TauCeti.image_add_smul_Ico` — the affine image of `Ico 0 D` is a segment with its terminal
  endpoint removed.

The origin-at-an-end and origin-in-the-middle criteria are consumed by
`TauCeti/Analysis/Complex/Conformal/Poincare/Betweenness.lean`, which identifies the hyperbolic
segments of the Poincaré disc issuing from, or straddling, the origin with the Euclidean ones; `ℂ`
is a real inner product space with `⟪w, z⟫_ℝ = (z * conj w).re`
(`Complex.inner`), so the two inner-product criteria translate the ray and norm conditions into
complex-number formulas.
The affine half-open segment result is consumed by
`TauCeti/Analysis/Complex/Conformal/SchwarzChristoffel/UnboundedEdge.lean`.
