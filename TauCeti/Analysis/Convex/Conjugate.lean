# The Legendre–Fenchel conjugate on a real dual pair

Let `E` and `F` be real vector spaces paired by a bilinear form `B : E →ₗ[ℝ] F →ₗ[ℝ] ℝ`, written
`⟪x, y⟫ = B x y`. The *Legendre–Fenchel conjugate* of an extended-real function `f : E → EReal` is
the function

`f⋆ y = ⨆ x, (⟪x, y⟫ - f x)`

on `F`. It is the basic operation of convex analysis: it turns a function into the supremum of
the affine functions `y ↦ ⟪x, y⟫ - f x` indexed by the points of `E`, so whatever `f` is, it is
convex, and it is lower semicontinuous for any topology on `F` making every functional `B x`
continuous. When the pairing is separating and `E` carries a locally convex topology compatible
with it (for instance the weak topology `σ(E, F)`), the Fenchel–Moreau theorem describes the
biconjugate `f⋆⋆`. If `f` lies above some affine function `x ↦ ⟪x, y⟫ + c` (so in particular `f`
never takes the value `⊥`), then `f⋆⋆` is the largest lower-semicontinuous convex minorant of
`f`; in particular `f⋆⋆ = f` when `f` is proper, convex and lower semicontinuous. If `f` has no
such affine minorant, for instance when `f x = ⊥` at some point
(`TauCeti.fenchelConjugate_eq_top_of_eq_bot`), then `f⋆ ≡ ⊤` and `f⋆⋆ ≡ ⊥`, even though the
lower-semicontinuous convex minorants of `f` need not all be `⊥`. The equality `f⋆⋆ = f` needs a
separation theorem and is proved in `TauCeti.Analysis.Convex.FenchelMoreau`, for a pairing that
represents every continuous linear functional. For a bare bilinear pairing only the inequality
`f⋆⋆ ≤ f` holds (for the zero pairing, `f⋆⋆` is the constant `⨅ x, f x`). This file contains the
algebraic part of the theory, valid on a bare dual pair: the conjugate itself, the Fenchel–Young
inequality, the antitone Galois connection between the functions on `E` and on `F` that the
conjugate and its transpose `B.flip` form, the biconjugate inequality `f⋆⋆ ≤ f` and the bound of
`f⋆⋆` from below by every affine minorant of `f`, the triple-conjugate identity `f⋆⋆⋆ = f⋆`, the
normalisation rule for an additive constant, the convexity of every conjugate, and its lower
semicontinuity for any topology on `F` making every functional `B x` continuous.

The codomain is `EReal` throughout: the supremum defining `f⋆` can be `+∞` even for a finite `f`,
and it is `-∞` exactly when `f ≡ +∞`. The only subtraction that occurs is `⟪x, y⟫ - f x`, a real
number minus an extended real, which is always defined and never of the form `∞ - ∞`; the value
`f x = -∞` gives the term `+∞`, and `f x = +∞` gives the term `-∞`, which contributes nothing to
the supremum. Consequently every statement that adds `f x` to `f⋆ y` carries the hypotheses that
keep `⊥ + ⊤` from arising, and those hypotheses are recorded exactly rather than replaced by a
blanket properness assumption.

For a self-paired real seminormed inner product space, `B` is `innerₗ E`, whose transpose is itself.
The two Galois-connection maps therefore coincide, and every conjugate is lower semicontinuous for
the seminorm topology, since the inner product is continuous in each variable.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.fenchelConjugate B f` — the Legendre–Fenchel conjugate `y ↦ ⨆ x, (B x y - f x)`.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.sub_le_fenchelConjugate` and `TauCeti.le_add_fenchelConjugate` — the **Fenchel–Young
  inequality** `⟪x, y⟫ ≤ f x + f⋆ y`, in the subtraction form that needs no hypothesis and in the
  additive form that needs neither summand to be `-∞`;
* `TauCeti.fenchelConjugate_le_iff_fenchelConjugate_flip_le` and
  `TauCeti.fenchelConjugate_galoisConnection` — `f⋆ ≤ g` and `g⋆ ≤ f` both say that the pair
  `(f, g)` satisfies the Fenchel–Young inequality; the conjugate for `B` and the conjugate for
  the transposed pairing `B.flip` form an antitone Galois connection;
* `TauCeti.fenchelConjugate_flip_fenchelConjugate_le` — the biconjugate inequality `f⋆⋆ ≤ f`,
  `TauCeti.coe_add_le_fenchelConjugate_flip_fenchelConjugate` — every affine minorant
  `x ↦ ⟪x, y⟫ + c` of `f` lies below `f⋆⋆`, and
  `TauCeti.fenchelConjugate_fenchelConjugate_flip_fenchelConjugate` — `f⋆⋆⋆ = f⋆`;
* `TauCeti.fenchelConjugate_eq_bot_iff` — `f⋆ y = -∞` exactly when `f ≡ +∞`, and
  `TauCeti.fenchelConjugate_eq_top_of_eq_bot` — `f⋆ ≡ +∞` as soon as `f` takes the value `-∞`;
* `TauCeti.fenchelConjugate_add_const` — adding a real constant to `f` subtracts it from `f⋆`;
* `TauCeti.convex_epigraph_fenchelConjugate` — the real epigraph of a conjugate is convex, and
  `TauCeti.lowerSemicontinuous_fenchelConjugate` — a conjugate is lower semicontinuous for any
  topology on `F` making every functional `B x` continuous, such as the weak topology of the
  pairing, and `TauCeti.lowerSemicontinuous_fenchelConjugate_innerₗ` — for the inner product
  pairing of a real seminormed inner product space, every conjugate is lower semicontinuous.

## Implementation notes

The conjugate is a supremum, so `f x = +∞` is harmless and `f x = -∞` is the degenerate value,
whereas for the infimal `c`-transform of optimal transport the roles of the two infinities are
exchanged. Up to the sign change `c (x, y) = -B x y` and the negation of both potentials the two
transforms agree, but the sup-based normal form is the one used throughout convex analysis and
by the differentiability theory of convex functions, so it is developed on its own terms here.
The bridge between the two is a statement about the quadratic transport cost `‖x - y‖ ^ 2 / 2`,
whose `c`-concave potentials are exactly `‖x‖ ^ 2 / 2 - u x` for `u` a conjugate
(`TauCeti.MeasureTheory.OptimalTransport.CTransform.Quadratic`).

Convexity of a conjugate is stated as convexity of the real epigraph
`{p : F × ℝ | f⋆ p.1 ≤ p.2}` rather than through `ConvexOn`, whose scalar action would have to
be defined on `EReal`.
