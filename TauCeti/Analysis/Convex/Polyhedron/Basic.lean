# Convex polyhedra

A *convex polyhedron* in a real topological vector space is the solution set of finitely many
non-strict affine inequalities `g i x ≤ 0`, the `g i` being continuous affine functionals. This
file introduces that predicate and the three closure properties a piecewise-linear calculus needs:
a convex polyhedron is closed and convex, a finite intersection of convex polyhedra is one, and
the preimage of one under a continuous affine map is one.

Those last two are exactly what makes the cells of a piecewise-affine decomposition composable:
composing two piecewise-affine maps refines the source decomposition by pulling the target cells
back along the affine pieces, and both operations must stay inside the class of cells.

The name is deliberately *not* `IsPolyhedron`. In piecewise-linear topology a polyhedron is a
much weaker notion — a subset that is locally a cone, so a locally finite union of simplices,
which need not be convex. The convex sets defined here are the *cells* out of which such a
polyhedron is assembled.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.IsConvexPolyhedron`: the solution set of finitely many non-strict affine inequalities.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.isConvexPolyhedron_setOf_forall`: the defining form, with the inequalities indexed by
  an arbitrary finite type rather than by `Fin n`.
* `TauCeti.IsConvexPolyhedron.isClosed` and `TauCeti.IsConvexPolyhedron.convex`: a convex
  polyhedron is closed and convex, which is what its name claims.
* `TauCeti.IsConvexPolyhedron.inter`: an intersection of two convex polyhedra is one.
* `TauCeti.IsConvexPolyhedron.preimage`: the preimage of a convex polyhedron under a continuous
  affine map is one.
