# The supporting line of `x ↦ x * log x`

The function `x ↦ x * log x` of Mathlib's `Mathlib.Analysis.SpecialFunctions.Log.NegMulLog` is
strictly convex on the nonnegative reals. This file records the two estimates about it that the
optimisation arguments over matrices and over measures use: the tangent line at a positive point
lies below the graph at every nonnegative point, and the loss of the function at a point that gives
up a small amount of its value is bounded by that same tangent line.

## Main results

* `Real.mul_log_sub_mul_log_ge`: for `0 < a` and `0 ≤ u`,
  `u * log u - a * log a ≥ (u - a) * (log a + 1)`.
* `Real.sub_mul_log_le`: for `0 ≤ t` and `t ≤ x / 2`,
  `(x - t) * log (x - t) - x * log x ≤ -t * (log x - log 2 + 1)`.
* `TauCeti.sq_sqrt_sub_sqrt_le_mul_log_sub_mul_log_sub`: for `0 < a` and `0 ≤ u`, the gap
  between the graph and the supporting line at `a` is at least `(√u - √a) ^ 2`.

The first estimate is the tangent line at `a`, whose slope `log a + 1` is the derivative
`Real.deriv_mul_log` of the function. It is stated for `u = 0` as well, where the convention
`0 * log 0 = 0` of Mathlib makes its left side `-a * log a`, so that it applies at the boundary of
the domain without a case split.

The second estimate is the loss of the function at a value `x` that gives up an amount `t`: the
tangent line at `x - t` bounds the loss by `-t * (log (x - t) + 1)`, and the hypothesis
`t ≤ x / 2`, which bounds `log (x - t)` from below by `log x - log 2`, is where the constant
`log 2` of the statement comes from. It is stated for `t = 0`, and for the `x = 0` that the
hypotheses then force, so that a caller whose amount `t` may vanish needs no separate case.

The third estimate quantifies the first. The gap `u * log u - a * log a - (u - a) * (log a + 1)`
equals `u * log (u / a) - u + a`, the integrand of a relative entropy, and `(√u - √a) ^ 2` is the
integrand of a squared Hellinger distance, so it is the pointwise comparison of these two
divergences. It is what makes relative entropy quantitatively strictly convex.

`0 ≤ t` and `t ≤ x / 2`, is at most `-t * (log x - log 2 + 1)`: the supporting line

`x - t ≥ x / 2` bounds `log (x - t)` from below by `log x - log 2`.

The case `x = 0`, which the hypotheses force together with `t = 0` and which makes both sides
zero, is included. -/

/-- The gap between the convex function `u ↦ u * log u` and its supporting line at a positive
point `a` dominates the squared difference of square roots: for every nonnegative `u`,
`(√u - √a) ^ 2 ≤ u * log u - a * log a - (u - a) * (log a + 1)`. This strengthens
`Real.mul_log_sub_mul_log_ge`; the right side is `u * log (u / a) - u + a`. -/
