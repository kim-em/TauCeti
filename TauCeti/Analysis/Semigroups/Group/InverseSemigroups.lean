# Gluing inverse semigroups into a strongly continuous group

Two strongly continuous semigroups form the positive and negative halves of a strongly continuous
group when their operators at equal times are mutual inverses. This file constructs the group by
using the first semigroup at nonnegative times and the second one at nonpositive times.

The construction isolates the gluing step used in generation results for two-sided groups. In
particular, a Stone-type construction can generate contraction semigroups for an operator and its
negative separately, prove that their operators are inverse, and then apply
`StronglyContinuousSemigroup.toGroupOfInverse`.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.Semigroups.StronglyContinuousSemigroup.comp_comm_of_inverse`: operators from the two
  semigroups commute, even at different times.
* `TauCeti.Semigroups.StronglyContinuousSemigroup.toGroupOfInverse`: glue two mutually inverse
  C₀-semigroups into a C₀-group.
* `TauCeti.Semigroups.StronglyContinuousSemigroup.toGroupOfInverse_toSemigroup`: the positive half
  of the glued group is the first semigroup.
* `TauCeti.Semigroups.StronglyContinuousSemigroup.toGroupOfInverse_reflect_toSemigroup`: the
  positive half of the reflected group is the second semigroup.
* `TauCeti.Semigroups.StronglyContinuousGroup.eq_toGroupOfInverse`: conversely, a C₀-group is the
  group glued from its own two halves, so gluing is inverse to splitting.
