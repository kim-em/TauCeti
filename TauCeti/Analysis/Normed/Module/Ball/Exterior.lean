# The exterior of a closed ball is preconnected

In a real normed space of dimension at least two the complement of a closed ball is preconnected:
it is the union, over the radii `M` exceeding the ball's, of the spheres of radius `M`, strung
together along a single ray from the centre.

Every unbounded complementary component of a bounded set meets the exterior of any closed ball
containing that set. Preconnectedness of the exterior therefore forces all such components to
coincide. This uniqueness result and the corresponding filled-hull alternative are proved in
`TauCeti/Analysis/Normed/Module/FilledHull.lean`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.isPreconnected_compl_closedBall` — the exterior of a closed ball is preconnected in a
  real normed space of dimension at least two.
