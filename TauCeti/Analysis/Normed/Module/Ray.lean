# Rays chained along a partition

Mathlib's `SameRay.trans` chains two ray relations `SameRay R x y` and `SameRay R y z` into
`SameRay R x z`, provided the middle vector `y` vanishes only when `x` or `z` does. This file
iterates that step along a finite ordered partition of an interval in a linear order: if a map
`w` into a normed additive group with an ordered scalar module structure lies, on each piece of
the partition, on the ray of its value at the end of that piece, and the norm of `w` is
nondecreasing, then every value of `w` lies on the ray of the final value. Monotonicity of the norm
supplies the side condition of `SameRay.trans`: a partition point where `w` vanishes is preceded
only by zeros. No compatibility between the norm and scalar multiplication is needed.

The explicit-partition induction follows the pattern of the Apache-2.0
[`frenzymath/Poincare-Conjecture`](https://github.com/frenzymath/Poincare-Conjecture)
formalization, revision `24f32e4d600878bfaac6bc2f2f9324175571c321`, as used in
`TauCeti/Geometry/Manifold/Riemannian/EDistComparison.lean`.

/-- **Rays chain through a partition.** If a map `w` into a normed additive group with an ordered
scalar module structure lies, on each piece of an ordered partition, on the ray of its value at
the end of that piece, and its norm is nondecreasing, then every value lies on the ray of the final
value. Monotonicity of the norm rules out a zero at a partition point preceded by a nonzero
value. -/
