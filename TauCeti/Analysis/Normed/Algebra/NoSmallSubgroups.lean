# No small subgroups in the units of a normed ring

Let `A` be a normed ring with `‖n • a‖ = ‖n‖ * ‖a‖` for integers `n`, such as `ℤ`, `ℝ`, `ℂ`,
or an algebra of bounded operators. An element `z ≠ 1` of `A` has a power at distance more than
`1 / 2` from `1`: as long as `w` stays within `1 / 2` of `1`, the identity
`w² - 1 = 2 • (w - 1) + (w - 1)²` shows that squaring multiplies
the distance to `1` by at least `3 / 2`. Hence the only subgroup of `Aˣ` inside the closed ball
of radius `1 / 2` around `1` is trivial. For the unit circle alone,
Mathlib's `Circle.eq_one_of_forall_pow_mem_centeredArc_pi_div_two` is the analogous statement; the
version here applies to characters with values in `ℂˣ` that need not be unitary.

Integer norm homogeneity is expressed by `NormSMulClass ℤ A`. It holds in every real normed
space, but also permits rings without a real scalar action. For a generic real normed space,
the instance can be supplied locally using `norm_zsmul` from
`Mathlib.Analysis.Normed.Module.Basic`:

```lean
have : NormSMulClass ℤ A :=
  ⟨fun n a ↦ by simpa only [Int.norm_cast_real] using norm_zsmul ℝ n a⟩
```

For a continuous homomorphism `f` from a topological group `G` to `Aˣ`, the preimage of that ball
is a neighbourhood of `1`, and every subgroup of `G` inside it lies in the kernel of `f`. This is
how a continuous character of a group with arbitrarily small open subgroups, such as the units of
a nonarchimedean local field, is seen to be trivial on one of them.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.three_div_two_mul_norm_sub_one_le_norm_sq_sub_one`: if `‖w - 1‖ ≤ 1 / 2`, then squaring
  multiplies the distance to `1` by at least `3 / 2`.
* `TauCeti.eq_one_of_forall_norm_pow_sub_one_le`: an element all of whose powers lie within
  `1 / 2` of `1` is `1`.
* `ContinuousMonoidHom.exists_mem_nhds_one_forall_le_ker`: a continuous homomorphism into `Aˣ` is
  trivial on every subgroup contained in a suitable neighbourhood of `1`.
