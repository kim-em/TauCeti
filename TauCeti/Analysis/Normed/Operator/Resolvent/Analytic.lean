# Analyticity of an unbounded operator's resolvent

The resolvent of a `LinearPMap` on a complete normed space over a nontrivially normed field is
analytic on its resolvent set. Locally at a resolvent point `lambda`, the Neumann formula
identifies it with

`R(mu) = R(lambda) * (1 - (lambda - mu) R(lambda))⁻¹`.

The second factor is analytic near `lambda` because inversion in a complete normed algebra is
analytic at every unit. This gives analyticity in operator norm, rather than merely pointwise
analyticity after applying the resolvent to a vector.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.LinearPMap.analyticAt_resolvent`: the resolvent is analytic at each point of its
  resolvent set.
* `LinearPMap.analyticOnNhd_resolvent`: the resolvent is analytic throughout its
  resolvent set.
