# Resolvents and restriction of scalars

An unbounded operator `A : X →ₗ.[𝕜'] X` over a normed field extension `𝕜'` can also be read over a
smaller field `𝕜`, as `A.restrictScalars 𝕜`. This file shows that the two resolvent notions
agree at the points of `𝕜`: for `mu : 𝕜`,

`mu ∈ resolventSet (A.restrictScalars 𝕜) ↔ algebraMap 𝕜 𝕜' mu ∈ resolventSet A`,

and the resolvents themselves correspond under `ContinuousLinearMap.restrictScalars`.
The actions on `X` form a scalar tower; no norm compatibility between the two fields is required.

Only the forward direction has content. A bounded `𝕜`-linear inverse `R` of `mu • I - A` is
automatically `𝕜'`-homogeneous: `z • R y` and `R (z • y)` have the same image under
`mu • I - A`, because `A` is `𝕜'`-linear, so they agree. This homogeneity statement also works
over an arbitrary ring algebra, without a norm or topology on the larger algebra.

This is what lets a real-variable theorem about an operator on a complex Banach space — such as
the Laplace-transform resolvent of a C₀-semigroup, which is built over `ℝ` — be read as a
statement about the genuinely complex resolvent set.

## Main results

* `LinearPMap.IsResolventAt.restrictScalars`: restricting scalars in an inverse of
  `lambda • I - A`.
* `TauCeti.LinearPMap.map_smul_of_isResolventAt_restrictScalars`: a bounded inverse over `𝕜` is
  `𝕜'`-homogeneous.
* `TauCeti.LinearPMap.exists_isResolventAt_of_isResolventAt_restrictScalars`: it therefore comes
  from an inverse over `𝕜'`.
* `TauCeti.LinearPMap.mem_resolventSet_restrictScalars_iff`: the resolvent sets agree at the
  points of `𝕜`.
* `TauCeti.LinearPMap.restrictScalars_resolvent`: the resolvents agree there.
