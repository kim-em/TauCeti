# Dirichlet domains of Fuchsian groups

Let `Γ ≤ PSL(2, ℝ)` be discrete and let `p ∈ ℍ` have trivial stabilizer in `Γ`. The Dirichlet
domain `TauCeti.dirichletDomain Γ p` consists of the points of `ℍ` hyperbolically at least as
close to `p` as to every other point of the orbit `Γ • p`. It is a closed measurable fundamental
domain for `Γ`: its translates cover `ℍ`, and two distinct translates meet only along a
hyperbolic perpendicular bisector, which has zero area. In particular the covolume of `Γ` is the
hyperbolic area of any Dirichlet domain centred at a point with trivial stabilizer, and every
discrete subgroup has such a Dirichlet domain, since points with trivial stabilizer exist.

The Dirichlet domain is the starting point of the Dirichlet polygon: for a cofinite group it is a
finite-sided convex hyperbolic polygon whose sides are paired by elements of `Γ`. Its geodesic
convexity and closed-half-plane description are supplied by
`TauCeti.UpperHalfPlane.geodesicSegment_subset_dirichletDomain` and
`TauCeti.UpperHalfPlane.dirichletDomain_eq_iInter_closure_leftHalfPlane`.

The imported `TauCeti.dirichletFace` API describes its equality faces: these cover the boundary,
form a locally finite family, and the face indexed by `g` is paired with that indexed by `g⁻¹`
by the transformation `g⁻¹`. Nontrivial faces are geodesically convex boundary pieces, and
nonempty bounded faces are geodesic segments. Global finite-sidedness and the construction of
ideal vertices require further polygon geometry.

## Main results

* `Subgroup.isFundamentalDomain_dirichletDomain`: a Dirichlet domain centred at a point with
  trivial stabilizer is a fundamental domain.
* `Subgroup.exists_isFundamentalDomain_dirichletDomain`: every discrete subgroup has a Dirichlet
  fundamental domain.
