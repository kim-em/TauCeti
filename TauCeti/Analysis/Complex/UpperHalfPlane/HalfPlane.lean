# Half-planes bounded by a geodesic line

The imaginary axis splits `ℍ` into two open half-planes, `{z | 0 < z.re}` and
`{z | z.re < 0}`, and the axis itself, `{z | z.re = 0}`. This file transports that picture by
`g : PSL(2, ℝ)`, the same idiom `Geodesic.lean` uses for the line itself: `rightHalfPlane g`
and `leftHalfPlane g` are the `g`-images of the two canonical sides, `Set.range (geodesicLine g)`
(via `range_geodesicLine`) is the `g`-image of the axis, and the three are pairwise disjoint and
cover `ℍ` (`rightHalfPlane_union_range_geodesicLine_union_leftHalfPlane`).

The labelling is not determined by `geodesicLine g` alone: which side is called `right` depends
on the chosen representing `g`, and the two sides are genuinely distinct
(`rightHalfPlane_ne_leftHalfPlane`). `pslS`, the element of `PSL(2, ℝ)` representing `z ↦ -1/z`,
witnesses this non-canonicity: for `g' = g * pslS`,
`Set.range (geodesicLine g') = Set.range (geodesicLine g)` (`range_geodesicLine_mul_pslS`)
but `rightHalfPlane g' = leftHalfPlane g` (`rightHalfPlane_mul_pslS`) — `z ↦ -1/z` fixes
`{z | z.re = 0}` setwise and sends `1 + i` to `-1/2 + i/2`. That every pair of representatives
with the same line image gives the same *unordered* pair of sides is not proved here.

The sides also have an equation. For a representative `!![a, b; c, d]` of `g`, the real part of
`g⁻¹ • z` is a positive multiple of `sideForm g z = -(c d) |z|² + (a d + b c) Re z - a b`
(`exists_pos_re_inv_smul_eq`), a quantity unchanged by negating the representative. Hence the
left half-plane of `g` is `{sideForm g < 0}`, the geodesic line is `{sideForm g = 0}` and the
right half-plane is `{sideForm g > 0}`.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.UpperHalfPlane.rightHalfPlane g`, `TauCeti.UpperHalfPlane.leftHalfPlane g` — the two
  open half-planes bounded by `geodesicLine g`, as `g`-translates of the canonical pair for the
  raw imaginary axis; `rightHalfPlane_def`/`leftHalfPlane_def` restate the body.
  `mem_rightHalfPlane_iff` and `mem_leftHalfPlane_iff` test membership directly, without
  unfolding the translate;
  `rightHalfPlane_one`/`leftHalfPlane_one` and `smul_rightHalfPlane`/`smul_leftHalfPlane` give
  their value at `g = 1` and their equivariance, matching `Geodesic.lean`'s own API for the line.
* `TauCeti.UpperHalfPlane.isOpen_rightHalfPlane`, `isOpen_leftHalfPlane` — both are open.
* `TauCeti.UpperHalfPlane.disjoint_rightHalfPlane_leftHalfPlane`,
  `disjoint_rightHalfPlane_range_geodesicLine`, `disjoint_leftHalfPlane_range_geodesicLine` — the
  three pieces are pairwise disjoint, and
  `TauCeti.UpperHalfPlane.rightHalfPlane_union_range_geodesicLine_union_leftHalfPlane` says
  they cover `ℍ`.
* `TauCeti.UpperHalfPlane.rightHalfPlane_nonempty`, `leftHalfPlane_nonempty`, and
  `rightHalfPlane_ne_leftHalfPlane` — the two half-planes are nonempty and genuinely distinct.
* `TauCeti.UpperHalfPlane.frontier_rightHalfPlane`, `frontier_leftHalfPlane` — the geodesic line
  is the topological boundary of each half-plane it bounds, via `closure_rightHalfPlane` and
  `closure_leftHalfPlane`; `mem_closure_rightHalfPlane_iff`/`mem_closure_leftHalfPlane_iff` test
  membership in the closed half-planes directly.
* `TauCeti.UpperHalfPlane.rightHalfPlane_mul_pslS`, `leftHalfPlane_mul_pslS` — witness that
  `rightHalfPlane`/`leftHalfPlane` depend on the chosen representative of a geodesic line, not
  just its image (`TauCeti.pslS` is the `PSL(2, ℝ)` element of `z ↦ -1/z`;
  `Geodesic.lean`'s `range_geodesicLine_mul_pslS` is the companion fact for the line itself).
* `TauCeti.UpperHalfPlane.rightHalfPlane_mul_dilation`, `leftHalfPlane_mul_dilation` — by
  contrast, reparametrising a geodesic line by a dilation (`geodesicLine_mul_dilation`) changes
  neither half-plane.
* `TauCeti.UpperHalfPlane.sideForm g`: the real quadratic form whose sign is the side of
  `geodesicLine g`, with `sideForm_mk` and `sideForm_mk_ofReal` in the entries of a
  representative; `mem_leftHalfPlane_iff_sideForm_neg`, `mem_rightHalfPlane_iff_sideForm_pos`,
  `mem_range_geodesicLine_iff_sideForm_eq_zero`, `mem_closure_leftHalfPlane_iff_sideForm_nonpos`;
  `sideForm_mul_dilation`: it too is unchanged by a dilation;
  `exists_sideForm_eq_mul_normSq_sub`: a side form vanishing at two points of a circle centred on
  the real axis, with distinct real parts, is a multiple of the circle's equation.
