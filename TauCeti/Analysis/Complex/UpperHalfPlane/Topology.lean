# Topology of the upper half-plane

Every real point lies in the closure of the open upper half-plane, so limits taken along the
half-plane at a real point are well posed.  The half-plane is also unbounded, so the filter along
which it approaches infinity is nontrivial and limits taken along it are unique.

For a function conjugation-symmetric near infinity, decay along the upper half-plane implies
decay along the whole plane, provided it is continuous at sufficiently distant real points.

A continuous injection of the closed upper half-plane sends every real point to the frontier of
the image of the open half-plane.  The inversion `w ↦ -w⁻¹` preserves the closed upper
half-plane, and so transfers limits at infinity in it to limits at `0`.

A function on the upper half-plane, extended to `ℂ` by `ofComplex`, is periodic with a real
period exactly when the original function is invariant under the corresponding translation.

The real-part map `re : ℍ → ℝ` is continuous and open, so taking closures commutes with taking
preimages under it. In particular the closure of the open half-plane `{z | a < z.re}` is the
closed half-plane `{z | a ≤ z.re}`, and likewise for `{z | z.re < a}`; transported by the
`PSL(2, ℝ)`-action, this identifies the boundary of a half-plane bounded by a geodesic line.

Since `w ↦ re w + exp (im w) i` is a continuous bijection from `ℂ` onto `ℍ`, the complement of a
countable subset of `ℍ` is path connected and dense, as it is in the plane. Removing countably
many points, such as the vertices of a tessellation, therefore keeps `ℍ` connected.
