# Geodesic segments, rays and lines between points of `ℍ ∪ ∂ℍ`

For points `p`, `q` of `ℍ ∪ ∂ℍ`, modelled as `ℍ ⊕ OnePoint ℝ`, `extGeodesicSegment p q` is the
closed piece of the geodesic through `p` and `q` lying between them, as a set of points of `ℍ`:
the segment `geodesicSegment z w` between two points of `ℍ`, the ray from a point of `ℍ` towards
an ideal point, and the whole geodesic line between two distinct ideal points. Between an ideal
point and itself it is empty. The piece does not depend on the order of `p` and `q`
(`extGeodesicSegment_comm`), contains the endpoints that lie in `ℍ`, lies on every geodesic
line running from `p` to `q` (`extGeodesicSegment_subset_range_geodesicLine`), and is
equivariant under `PSL(2, ℝ)` (`smul_extGeodesicSegment`).

Closed half-planes are convex in this extended sense: if `p` and `q` are weakly to the left of
`geodesicLine k` (`extClosedLeftHalfPlane k`), then so is the piece between them
(`extGeodesicSegment_subset_closure_leftHalfPlane`), and in particular a geodesic ray or line
whose endpoints are weakly to the left of `geodesicLine k` lies in its closed left half-plane
(`geodesicLine_image_Ici_subset_closure_leftHalfPlane`,
`range_geodesicLine_subset_closure_leftHalfPlane`). Away from finite endpoints, this containment
is strict unless the supporting lines coincide
(`mem_leftHalfPlane_of_mem_extGeodesicSegment`).

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.UpperHalfPlane.extGeodesicSegment p q`: the closed geodesic piece between two
  points of `ℍ ∪ ∂ℍ`.
* `TauCeti.UpperHalfPlane.extGeodesicSegment_comm`,
  `TauCeti.UpperHalfPlane.smul_extGeodesicSegment`: symmetry and equivariance.
* `TauCeti.UpperHalfPlane.geodesicLine_image_Ici` and
  `TauCeti.UpperHalfPlane.geodesicLine_image_Iic`: half-lines in a geodesic parametrization are
  the canonical extended geodesic segments with one ideal endpoint.
* `TauCeti.UpperHalfPlane.extGeodesicSegment_subset_closure_leftHalfPlane`: closed
  half-planes are convex.
