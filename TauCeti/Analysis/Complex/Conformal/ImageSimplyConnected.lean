# Images of open simply connected sets under injective holomorphic maps

A holomorphic map that is injective on an open set `Ω ⊆ ℂ` carries `Ω` to an open set, and carries
a simply connected `Ω` to a simply connected set. Openness is used by the Riemann mapping theorem
(in the Koebe square-root step); the transport of simple connectivity is a standalone topological
fact, which that proof does not need, since it carries holomorphic square roots across such a map
instead (`TauCeti.HasHolomorphicSquareRoots.image`).

## The argument

Openness is the open mapping theorem. It is local, so it needs no connectivity hypothesis on `Ω`:
around each point of `Ω` sits a ball on which `g` is analytic and — being injective — nonconstant,
and `Mathlib.Analysis.Complex.OpenMapping` opens that ball.

Simple connectivity is then purely topological, and Mathlib supplies it: injectivity and
continuity make `Ω.domRestrict g` an injective continuous map, openness makes it an open map,
hence a topological embedding, and `Topology.IsEmbedding.isSimplyConnected_image` transports
simple connectivity across an embedding. Holomorphy enters *only* through the open mapping
theorem; there is no separate homotopy argument here.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.isOpen_image_of_differentiableOn_of_injOn` — the image of an open set is open.
* `TauCeti.isSimplyConnected_image_of_differentiableOn_of_injOn` — the image of an open simply
  connected set is simply connected.

## Coordination with upstream Mathlib

The Riemann mapping theorem is being formalized upstream at
[mathlib4#33505](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/33505), which proves the
L0–L3 prerequisites internally as private lemmas. The declarations here are an explicitly
**temporary shim**: delete them and refactor downstream consumers onto the exported Mathlib
versions once those land.

The mathematical content beyond openness is Mathlib's
`Topology.IsEmbedding.isSimplyConnected_image`: the restriction of `g` to `Ω` is a topological
embedding, because it is continuous, injective, and open. -/
