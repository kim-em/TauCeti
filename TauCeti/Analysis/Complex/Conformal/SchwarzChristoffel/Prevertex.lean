# The prevertex residues of the pre-Schwarzian derivative

A conformal map of the upper half-plane onto a polygon is holomorphic across each open boundary
interval between two consecutive prevertices, and its pre-Schwarzian derivative
`logDeriv (deriv f) = f'' / f'` continues across those intervals to a conjugation-symmetric
function `φ` holomorphic off the prevertices.  This file computes the residue of `φ` at a
prevertex and turns the resulting partial-fraction expansion into the Schwarz--Christoffel
formula.

At a prevertex the map has a **corner power form**: `f = w + h ^ β` near the prevertex inside the
upper half-plane, for a holomorphic `h` with a simple zero there, where `β` is the interior angle
divided by `π`.  The pre-Schwarzian derivative of such an `f` has residue asymptotic
`(z - x) * f''(z) / f'(z) → β - 1` from above, and conjugation symmetry propagates that
asymptotic to the punctured neighbourhood, so `β - 1` is the residue of `φ` at the prevertex.
A prevertex may instead be carried to a vertex at infinity.  If that vertex has opening `β * π`
with `0 < β < 2`, then `f` is a negative power `h ^ (-β)` up to an affine map and the residue is
`-β - 1`; if it lies between two parallel sides, then `f` is a logarithm of a holomorphic function
with a simple zero, up to an affine map, and the residue is `-1`.
Once each prevertex contributes its residue and `φ` decays at infinity, partial fractions identify
`φ` with `∑ i, e i / (z - a i)` and the integration theorem identifies `f` itself with an affine
image of the Schwarz--Christoffel primitive.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.tendsto_sub_mul_nhdsNE_of_tendsto_nhdsWithin_im_pos` -- for a conjugation-symmetric
  `φ`, a residue asymptotic from the upper half-plane holds on the punctured neighbourhood.
* `TauCeti.tendsto_sub_mul_nhdsNE_of_eqOn_add_cpow` -- the continuation of the pre-Schwarzian
  derivative of a map with a corner power form has residue asymptotic `β - 1` at the
  corner.
* `TauCeti.tendsto_sub_mul_nhdsNE_of_sector` -- the same residue, derived from the geometric
  sector and boundary-ray conditions at a polygonal corner.
* `TauCeti.tendsto_sub_mul_nhdsNE_of_eqOn_div` -- the residue `-β - 1` at a prevertex carried to
  a vertex at infinity of opening `β * π`.
* `TauCeti.tendsto_sub_mul_nhdsNE_of_eqOn_exp` -- the residue `-1` at a prevertex carried to an
  end between two parallel sides.
* `TauCeti.eqOn_const_mul_schwarzChristoffelPrimitive_add_of_tendsto` -- a map of the upper
  half-plane whose pre-Schwarzian derivative continues with at most simple poles of residues
  `e i` at the prevertices `a i` and decays at infinity is an affine image of the
  Schwarz--Christoffel primitive for those data.

/-- **The pre-Schwarzian residue at a sector end at infinity is `-β - 1`.**  Let `φ` be
holomorphic on a punctured disc about a real point `x`, symmetric under conjugation, and agree with
the pre-Schwarzian derivative of `f` above the axis near `x`.  Invert the target about `c` and
rotate and scale it, by `w ↦ b / (w - c)`.  Suppose the result extends to a function `g` with
`g x = 0` which is continuous and injective on the closed upper part of a conjugation-symmetric
open neighbourhood `Ω` of `x`, takes the open upper part into the sector `|arg w| < β * π / 2`,
where `0 < β < 2`, and has its other boundary values on the two bounding rays.  Then
`(z - x) * φ z → -β - 1` as `z` tends to `x` from any direction.

In terms of `f`, the hypotheses say that `f` tends to infinity at `x` and near `x` fills a sector
of opening `β * π` at infinity, between two unbounded sides on lines through `c`, with the real
points on either side of `x` carried to those sides.  So the prevertex `x` represents a vertex at
infinity of opening `β * π`, and its turning exponent is `-β - 1`.  This is the finite-prevertex
counterpart of `TauCeti.tendsto_mul_logDeriv_deriv_upperHalfPlaneSet_of_eqOn_div_neg_inv`. -/

/-- **The pre-Schwarzian residue at a parallel-sided end is `-1`.**  Let `φ` be holomorphic on a
punctured disc about a real point `x`, symmetric under conjugation, and agree with the
pre-Schwarzian derivative of `f` above the axis near `x`.  Normalize the target by
`w ↦ (w - c) / b` and exponentiate.  Suppose the result extends to a function `g` with `g x = 0`
which is continuous and injective on the closed upper part of a conjugation-symmetric open
neighbourhood `Ω` of `x`, upper half-plane valued above the axis and real on it.  Then
`(z - x) * φ z → -1` as `z` tends to `x` from any direction.

The typical source of such a `g` is a map `f` which tends to infinity at `x` and near `x` fills a
half-strip between two parallel rays, with the real points on either side of `x` carried to those
rays.  Then `c` and `b` are chosen so that `w ↦ (w - c) / b` carries the half-strip to
`{w | w.re < 0 ∧ 0 < w.im ∧ w.im < π}`, which the exponential maps onto the upper half of the unit
disc.  So the prevertex `x` represents a vertex at infinity of opening `0`, and its turning
exponent is `-1`.  This is the opening-`0` counterpart of
`TauCeti.tendsto_sub_mul_nhdsNE_of_sector`, and the finite-prevertex counterpart of
