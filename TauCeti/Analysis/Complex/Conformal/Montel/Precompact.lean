# Montel's theorem: local boundedness is relative compactness

Layer **L1 (normal families / Montel)** of the conformal-mapping roadmap
(`TauCetiRoadmap/ConformalMapping/README.md`) states its milestone as

> locally bounded ⇒ precompact for `TendstoLocallyUniformlyOn`,

and `Conformal/Montel/Basic.lean` records the *selection* consequence: every sequence drawn from a
locally bounded family of holomorphic functions has a locally uniformly convergent subsequence.
This file isolates the compactness statement that selection consequence rests on, in the space
where "precompact" literally means precompact — the space `C(↥Ω, E)` of continuous maps on the
domain with its compact-open topology, whose convergence *is* locally uniform convergence — and
shows that local boundedness is not merely sufficient for it but equivalent to it.

## The two directions

A family `F : ι → ℂ → E` of functions holomorphic on an open `Ω` restricts to a family
`f : ι → C(↥Ω, E)`; the theorems below take that restriction as a hypothesis
`⇑(f i) = Ω.domRestrict (F i)` rather than fixing one bundling, so that a caller which already
carries such an `f` may use them directly. The hypothesis constrains nothing: a caller holding
`hF : ∀ i, ContinuousOn (F i) Ω` and no `f` of its own takes
`fun i => ⟨Ω.domRestrict (F i), (hF i).domRestrict⟩`, for which it holds by `rfl`.

*Locally bounded ⇒ relatively compact* is the compact-open Arzelà–Ascoli theorem
`ArzelaAscoli.isCompact_closure_of_equicontinuous`: equicontinuity is
`TauCeti.IsLocallyBoundedOn.equicontinuousOn`, which is Cauchy's estimate, and pointwise relative
compactness is local boundedness at a single point. This is the direction with analytic content —
holomorphy enters only through the Cauchy estimate behind the equicontinuity.

That pointwise step is also the only place the target matters: a norm bound confines the values to
a closed ball, and for the ball to be compact `E` must be proper. So this direction is stated for
a proper `E` — for a normed space over `ℂ` that is exactly finite-dimensionality — and the
converse, which merely reads a bound off a compact set, for an arbitrary one.

*Relatively compact ⇒ locally bounded* is a soft argument and needs no holomorphy at all, nor even
openness of `Ω` or a complex domain: it is stated for a set `Ω` in an arbitrary topological space,
because local compactness of the subtype `↥Ω` is all it uses. On a compact `K ⊆ Ω` the
product `closure (range f) ×ˢ (Subtype.val ⁻¹' K)` is compact, local compactness of `↥Ω` makes
evaluation `C(↥Ω, E) × ↥Ω → E` continuous in both variables at once, and a continuous real function
on a compact set is bounded. The bound obtained is uniform in the index, which is exactly
`TauCeti.IsLocallyBoundedOn`.

Together they give `TauCeti.isCompact_closure_range_iff_isLocallyBoundedOn`: for a family of
holomorphic maps of an open set into a proper `E`, relative compactness in `C(↥Ω, E)` and local
boundedness are the same condition.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.isCompact_closure_range_of_isLocallyBoundedOn` — a locally bounded family of
  holomorphic maps of an open set into a proper `E` is relatively compact in `C(↥Ω, E)`.
* `TauCeti.isLocallyBoundedOn_of_isCompact_closure_range` — the converse, for any family of
  maps on a set in a topological space whose subtype is locally compact.
* `TauCeti.isCompact_closure_range_iff_isLocallyBoundedOn` — the two are equivalent.

## Coordination with upstream Mathlib

Per the *Coordination with upstream Mathlib* section of `ConformalMapping/README.md`, L0–L3
material overlaps [mathlib4#33505](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/33505),
the in-progress human-curated Riemann-mapping-theorem effort, which proves a Montel
equicontinuity statement internally as a private lemma. **Like `Conformal/Montel/Basic.lean`, this
file is therefore a temporary shim**: once the corresponding Mathlib results land, these statements
should be backed by them — or deleted and their consumers refactored — rather than maintained as an
independent re-proof. What Tau Ceti adds at L1 is named, discoverable API, not first proof.

This is the **analytic** normal-families theorem; it is deliberately not routed through Mathlib's
`Analysis/LocallyConvex/Montel.lean` (`MontelSpace`), which is an unrelated notion.

/-- **Montel's theorem, relative-compactness form.** A locally bounded family of holomorphic
maps of an open set `Ω ⊆ ℂ` into a proper complex normed space `E` restricts to a relatively
compact family in the space `C(↥Ω, E)` of continuous maps with the compact-open topology.

This is the precompactness the roadmap's L1 milestone asks for; `TauCeti.montel` is the sequential
selection statement extracted from it. The local boundedness hypothesis cannot be dropped once `E`
is nontrivial: on a nonempty open `Ω` the holomorphic family `F n z = n • v`, for a unit vector
`v : E`, restricts to a closed discrete — hence non-relatively-compact — family. On `Ω = ∅`, or on
the trivial `E = 0` where no unit vector exists, the conclusion holds regardless, so there is no
counterexample in those two degenerate cases. Properness of `E` cannot be dropped
either: it is what turns the pointwise norm bound into pointwise relative compactness, and for a
normed space over `ℂ` it says exactly that `E` is finite-dimensional. -/

/-- **The converse of Montel's theorem.** A family of maps on a set `Ω` with locally compact
subtype whose restrictions are relatively compact in `C(↥Ω, E)` is locally bounded on `Ω`.

No holomorphy is needed — not even a complex domain, nor continuity beyond what the restrictions
already carry — and no properness of the target: evaluation is continuous in the map and the point
together as soon as `↥Ω` is locally compact (for an open `Ω ⊆ ℂ` the instance is
`IsOpen.locallyCompactSpace`), so a continuous real function on the compact product
`closure (Set.range f) ×ˢ (Subtype.val ⁻¹' K)` is bounded — and its bound is uniform in the index,
which is what local boundedness asserts. -/
