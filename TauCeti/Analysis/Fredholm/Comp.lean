# Composition of Fredholm operators

This file proves that the index of a composite of Fredholm operators between normed spaces is the
sum of their indices, over an arbitrary nontrivially normed scalar field. It also records the
corresponding statements for powers of a Fredholm endomorphism, which do assume a complete scalar
field, since they go through Mathlib's `ContinuousLinearMap.IsFredholm.comp`.

That a composite is Fredholm is Mathlib's `ContinuousLinearMap.IsFredholm.comp`.
Index additivity reuses Mathlib's `LinearMap.index_comp`, whose proof is the six-term exact
sequence

`0 → ker T → ker (S ∘ T) → ker S → coker T → coker (S ∘ T) → coker S → 0`.

These results supply the compositional calculus for the Fredholm operators and index theory in
Lane F0 of the analytic Heegaard Floer roadmap.

## Main declarations

* `ContinuousLinearMap.index_comp`: the index of a composite is the sum of the indices.
* `ContinuousLinearMap.IsFredholm.pow`: every power of a Fredholm endomorphism is Fredholm.
* `ContinuousLinearMap.index_pow`: the index of the `n`th power is `n` times the index.

The conventions and the composition theorem follow McDuff--Salamon,
*J-holomorphic Curves and Symplectic Topology*, Appendix A.1.
