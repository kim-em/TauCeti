# Regular level sets of a Fredholm map

Let `f : E → F` be a map between Banach spaces which is strictly differentiable at a point `a` of
the level set `{x | f x = c}`, and whose derivative `f'` there is a **surjective Fredholm
operator**. This file shows that the level set is, near `a`, homeomorphic to an open subset of
`ker f'`, a space whose dimension is exactly the Fredholm index of `f'`; and it packages that
local model, when the index is a fixed `n` along the whole level set, as a `ChartedSpace`
structure on `{x | f x = c}` modelled on `Fin n → 𝕜`.

This is the local half of the standard "a moduli space is the zero set of a Fredholm section, and
at a regular point it is a manifold of dimension the index" package (McDuff--Salamon,
*J-holomorphic Curves and Symplectic Topology*, Appendix A.3). The linear half is already available:
`ContinuousLinearMap.IsFredholm` provides the
finite-dimensional, topologically complemented kernel, and
`ContinuousLinearMap.index_of_surjective` identifies its dimension with the index. What is
added here is the nonlinear half, which is Mathlib's implicit function theorem for a map with
surjective derivative and complemented kernel,
`HasStrictFDerivAt.implicitToOpenPartialHomeomorphOfComplemented`, restricted to the level set:
that homeomorphism carries `{x | f x = c}` to the "vertical" slice `{c} × ker f'`, and the chart
below is the resulting homeomorphism of the level set with an open subset of `ker f'`.

Three consequences record that the dimension count is not vacuous, and are stated with Mathlib's
accumulation-point vocabulary `AccPt`. A point where the derivative is injective with closed range
— in particular a regular point of index `0` — is **isolated** in the level set through it, so a
compact piece of such a level set is **finite**: one ingredient in the well-definedness of a
Floer-type differential, which counts index-`0` solutions; making such a count well defined also
needs a separate compactness result placing the counted solutions inside one such piece, which is
not proved here. Where the kernel is nontrivial — in particular at a regular point of nonzero index
— the level set on the contrary accumulates at the point, so a level set is locally the single
point `a` precisely when the index vanishes.

What is proved is exactly a `ChartedSpace` structure, that is, a covering family of local models;
nothing more is claimed. In particular this is *not* the assertion that the level set is a
topological manifold in the usual sense, which would additionally need global hypotheses such as
second countability, and none are assumed here. Smooth compatibility of the charts, under a
`ContDiff` hypothesis on `f`, is `TauCeti.isManifold_levelSet` in
`TauCeti/Analysis/Fredholm/LevelSet/Manifold.lean`; the preferred charts installed below are
already cut down to `TauCeti.levelSetImplicitCoordSource` so that they can be compared smoothly.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.levelSetChart`: the chart `{x | f x = c} → ker f'` at a regular point `a`, given by
  projecting `x - a` onto `ker f'` along the chosen complement.
* `ContinuousLinearMap.kerModelEquiv`: the identification of `ker f'` with the model space
  `Fin n → 𝕜`, when `ker f'` is finite-dimensional of dimension `n`.
* `TauCeti.levelSetChartModel`: the chart read through that identification.
* `TauCeti.levelSetImplicitCoordSource`: the neighbourhood of a point of the level set to which the
  preferred chart there is cut down.
* `TauCeti.levelSetChartedSpace`: a regular level set on which the index is constantly `n` is a
  charted space modelled on `Fin n → 𝕜`; by
  `ContinuousLinearMap.index_of_surjective` the model dimension is the Fredholm index.
* `TauCeti.not_accPt_levelSet_of_injective_of_isClosed_range` and
  `TauCeti.not_accPt_levelSet_of_index_eq_zero`: a point where the derivative is injective with
  closed range, in particular a regular point of index `0`, is isolated in the level set through
  it.
* `TauCeti.isDiscrete_levelSet_inter_of_injective_of_isClosed_range`,
  `TauCeti.finite_levelSet_inter_of_injective_of_isClosed_range` and
  `TauCeti.finite_levelSet_inter_of_index_eq_zero`: hence such a piece of a level set is discrete,
  and a compact one is finite.
* `TauCeti.accPt_levelSet_of_nontrivial_ker` and `TauCeti.accPt_levelSet_of_index_ne_zero`: where
  the kernel is nontrivial, in particular in nonzero index, the level set accumulates at the
  point.

/-- **A regular level set of a Fredholm map is locally modelled on `Fin n → 𝕜`, `n` its index.**
If `f` is strictly differentiable at every point of the level set `{x | f x = c}` with surjective
Fredholm derivative of index `n` there, then the level set is a charted space modelled on
`Fin n → 𝕜`, the charts being the implicit-function charts `TauCeti.levelSetChartAt`.

This is a `ChartedSpace` structure only: no global hypothesis such as second countability is
assumed, so this does not by itself say that the level set is a topological manifold.

The definition is `irreducible`: its behaviour is available through
`TauCeti.levelSetChartedSpace_chartAt` and `TauCeti.levelSetChartedSpace_atlas`, which together
with the `TauCeti.levelSetChartAt_*` lemmas describe the installed charts, so no consumer needs to
unfold the structure literal. -/
