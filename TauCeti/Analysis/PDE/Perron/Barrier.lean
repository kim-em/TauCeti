# Perron's method: barriers and boundary values

Let `Ω` be a bounded open subset of a finite-dimensional real inner product space `E`, and let
`g` be bounded on `frontier Ω`. Perron's theorem (`TauCeti.harmonicOnNhd_perronSolution`) makes
the Perron solution `u = TauCeti.perronSolution Ω g` harmonic in `Ω`, but says nothing about its
boundary values. This file shows that `u` takes the value `g ξ` continuously at every point `ξ`
where `g` is continuous along `frontier Ω` and a **barrier** exists: a superharmonic function `w`,
continuous on `closure Ω`, vanishing at `ξ` and positive on the rest of `closure Ω`. A boundary
point admitting a barrier is called *regular*.

If every boundary point is regular, the Perron solution of continuous boundary data is
therefore continuous on `closure Ω` and equal to `g` on `frontier Ω`, and so solves the Dirichlet
problem `Δu = 0` in `Ω`, `u = g` on `frontier Ω`.

## Exterior sphere condition

If a closed ball `closedBall y R` meets `closure Ω` only at `ξ`, the function
`G(ξ - y) - G(x - y)`, built from the Newtonian kernel `G = TauCeti.newtonianKernel n` with pole
at `y`, is a barrier at `ξ` in `ℝⁿ` for `n ≠ 2`. In a two-dimensional space the logarithmic
function `log ‖x - y‖ - log ‖ξ - y‖` plays the same role. In every dimension `n`, the Dirichlet
problem in `ℝⁿ` is therefore solvable on every bounded open set satisfying this exterior sphere
condition at each boundary point.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.IsBarrier`: a barrier at a point relative to `Ω`.
* `TauCeti.tendsto_perronSolution_of_isBarrier`: at a point with a barrier where the boundary
  data is continuous, the Perron solution tends to the boundary value.
* `TauCeti.perronSolution_eq_of_isBarrier`: there the Perron solution equals the boundary value.
* `TauCeti.continuousOn_perronSolution`: if every boundary point admits a barrier, the Perron
  solution of continuous boundary data is continuous on `closure Ω`.
* `TauCeti.exists_harmonicOnNhd_continuousOn_closure_eqOn_frontier`: **the Dirichlet problem**
  is solvable when every boundary point admits a barrier.
* `TauCeti.isBarrier_newtonianKernel_sub`: the exterior sphere barrier in `ℝⁿ`, `n ≠ 2`.
* `TauCeti.isBarrier_log_norm_sub`: the logarithmic exterior sphere barrier in two dimensions.
* `TauCeti.exists_harmonicOnNhd_continuousOn_closure_eqOn_frontier_of_exterior_sphere`: the
  Dirichlet problem is solvable on bounded open subsets of `ℝⁿ` satisfying the exterior sphere
  condition.
