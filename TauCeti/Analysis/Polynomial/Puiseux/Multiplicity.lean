# Root collisions and multiplicities on the Puiseux hyperplane

Suppose a polynomial family has a complete analytic splitting near `(x₀, y₀)` and its
discriminant is `(y - y₀)^a` times an analytic unit. On the distinguished hyperplane
`y = y₀`, the equivalence relation identifying coincident root labels is locally constant.
Consequently the multiplicity of each labelled root of the specialized polynomial is
locally constant, even when several labels collide there.

These conclusions supply the multiplicity information needed to pass from a ramified
analytic splitting to distinct root sections. No constancy of multiplicities or collisions
is assumed. The splitting itself is an input; its construction is separate.

The proof uses `TauCeti.exists_root_sub_eq_pow_mul_unit`: a root difference with positive
exponent vanishes identically on the hyperplane, whereas one with exponent zero is a unit.
