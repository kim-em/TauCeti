# Construction of nonmonic Puiseux Laurent factorizations

A polynomial family with analytic coefficients and nonzero discriminant off a distinguished
hyperplane splits after substitution by the factorial of its degree. When its leading and
constant coefficients are powers of the distinguished coordinate times analytic units,
the roots have Laurent power times unit forms near every point of the hyperplane.
The integer exponents are locally independent of the parameter, and their pole orders are
bounded by the substituted leading-coefficient exponent. Degree drops and nullified fibers
on the hyperplane are allowed.

The construction joins `exists_analyticOnNhd_nonmonic_powerSubstitution`, which constructs
roots and removes their poles, with `TauCeti.exists_root_eq_zpow_mul_unit`, which extracts
unit forms from the analytic roots of integral normalization. Neither a root labelling nor
a splitting is an input. The trailing-coefficient hypothesis prevents roots from vanishing
identically or acquiring a parameter-dependent order.

/-- **Nonmonic Puiseux Laurent factorization with parameters.** Analytic coefficients,
constant degree and nonzero discriminant off `y = 0`, and power-times-unit leading and
constant coefficients suffice to construct a complete distinct splitting after `y = t ^ d!`.
Near every point of `t = 0`, all roots simultaneously have the form `t ^ e * w`, with
analytic nowhere-zero units and fixed integer exponents `e ≥ -(d! * a)`.
The same root labels have analytic extensions after multiplication by `t ^ (d! * a)`.
The original fibers on the hyperplane may drop degree or be zero. Degree zero is included. -/
