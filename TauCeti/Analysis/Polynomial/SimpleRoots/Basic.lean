# Simple roots depend analytically on the coefficients

`TauCeti.Sym.coeffEquiv` presents the `n`-th symmetric power of an algebraically closed field as
the affine space `Fin n → K` of coefficient tuples, and
`TauCeti/Analysis/Polynomial/SymmetricPower.lean` proves that presentation a *homeomorphism*: the
roots of a monic polynomial depend continuously on its coefficients. This file upgrades continuity
to **analyticity** wherever the roots are simple, which is the analytic input that the elementary
symmetric charts of `Sym^g(Σ)` need in order to be holomorphic.

## The argument

The roots are not a polynomial function of the coefficients, so nothing here is formal. The whole
file rests on one application of the implicit function theorem to the *free monic polynomial*

`f (c, z) = z ^ n + ∑ i, c i * z ^ i`,

that is, to `TauCeti.Polynomial.monicOfCoeff`, the specialization of Mathlib's
`Polynomial.freeMonic` at a concrete coefficient tuple. It is a polynomial in the coefficient tuple
`c` and the argument `z` jointly, hence analytic. Its partial derivative in `z` at a point
`(c₀, z₀)` is the scalar `P'(z₀)`, where `P` is the monic polynomial with lower coefficients `c₀`;
multiplication by that scalar is an invertible operator exactly when `z₀` is a **simple** root of
`P`. The implicit function theorem then produces a function `ψ` of the coefficients, analytic at
`c₀`, with `ψ c₀ = z₀`, whose value stays a root of the nearby polynomials:
`TauCeti.Polynomial.exists_analyticAt_isRoot_monicOfCoeff`.

Applying this at each of the `n` roots of a polynomial whose roots are pairwise distinct, and
noting that pairwise distinctness persists in a neighbourhood, gives an analytic *ordered*
parametrization `Ψ` of the whole unordered root tuple:
`TauCeti.Polynomial.exists_analyticAt_monicOfCoeff_eq_prod_X_sub_C`. This is the
multiplicity-free part of the inverse-chart statement. The colliding-point case over `ℂ` is proved
separately by the contour-integral argument in `TauCeti/Analysis/Polynomial/RootSum.lean`.

Note that no ordering of the roots is canonical: the conclusion is the existence of an analytic
ordered lift of the (unordered) inverse chart, not analyticity of a preferred root function.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.Polynomial.analyticAt_eval_monicOfCoeff`: the free monic polynomial is analytic in its
  coefficients and its argument jointly.
* `TauCeti.Polynomial.exists_analyticAt_isRoot_monicOfCoeff`: **a simple root moves analytically**
  with the coefficients.
* `TauCeti.Polynomial.exists_analyticAt_monicOfCoeff_eq_prod_X_sub_C`: a monic polynomial with `n`
  distinct roots has an analytic ordered parametrization of its roots on a neighbourhood of its
  coefficient tuple.
* `TauCeti.Sym.exists_analyticAt_coeffEquiv_symm_eq_ofFn`: the same statement read through the
  elementary symmetric chart, as an analytic ordered lift of the inverse chart.
* `TauCeti.Sym.exists_analyticAt_coeffEquiv_ofFn_localInverse`: **the coefficient map of an
  ordered tuple is a local analytic isomorphism** at every tuple of pairwise distinct points, the
  ordered lift being a two-sided local inverse there.
* `TauCeti.Sym.analyticAt_coeffEquiv_map_coeffEquiv_symm`: **a coordinate change acts analytically
  on the elementary symmetric coordinates at multiplicity-free points**. A map `φ` of the
  underlying field induces a map of coefficient tuples, sending the coefficients of a polynomial to
  those of the polynomial whose roots are the `φ`-images of its roots; it is analytic at every
  coefficient tuple whose roots are distinct and at which `φ` is analytic.

Lane F4.1 of the analytic Heegaard Floer roadmap opens with "`Sym^g(Σ)` geometry: smooth complex
structure (elementary symmetric functions)", after Ozsváth--Szabó
([arXiv:math/0101206](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0101206), §2.1). A holomorphic coordinate on the
surface identifies a neighbourhood in `Sym^g(Σ)` with an open subset of `Sym^g(ℂ)`
(`TauCeti.Sym.isOpenEmbedding_coeffEquiv_comp_map`), and
`TauCeti.Sym.analyticAt_coeffEquiv_map_coeffEquiv_symm` says that changing that coordinate acts
analytically on the elementary symmetric coordinates of one such patch, at multiplicity-free
tuples. That is the analytic ingredient for the transition maps of the atlas of
`TauCeti/Geometry/Manifold/SymmetricPower.lean`. A chart there splits a tuple into the factors
lying in `k` disjoint patches, of degrees `m 1, …, m k`, and regroups the resulting blocks of
coefficients along a bijection `(Σ i, Fin (m i)) ≃ Fin n`; the general blockwise assembly is in
`TauCeti/Analysis/Polynomial/RootSum/Family.lean`. The diagonal, where points collide, is covered
over `ℂ` by `TauCeti.Sym.analyticAt_coeffEquiv_map_coeffEquiv_symm_of_analyticAt` in
`TauCeti/Analysis/Polynomial/RootSum.lean`.

Everything is stated over an `RCLike` field, so it covers the real as well as the complex case,
except for the elementary polynomial calculus, which needs only a nontrivially normed field; only
the statements that mention the chart itself need the field algebraically closed.

/-- **A simple root moves analytically.** If `z₀` is a root of the monic polynomial with lower
coefficients `c₀` at which the derivative does not vanish, then there is a function `ψ` of the
coefficients, analytic at `c₀`, with `ψ c₀ = z₀`, whose value at every nearby coefficient tuple is
a root of the corresponding monic polynomial.

This is the analytic implicit root theorem `AnalyticAt.exists_analyticAt_eventually_eq_zero_iff`
applied to the free monic polynomial, whose partial derivative in the argument at `(c₀, z₀)` is
`P'(z₀)`. -/

points, then there is a tuple-valued function `Ψ`, analytic at `c₀`, with `Ψ c₀ = z`, which orders
the roots of every nearby monic polynomial.

No ordering of the roots is canonical, so the ordered lift `Ψ` is not unique; what is asserted is
that some analytic ordering exists near `c₀`. -/
