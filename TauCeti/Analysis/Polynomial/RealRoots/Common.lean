# Common ordered real roots of a finite family of real polynomials

Let `F k x`, for `k` in a finite index type, be real polynomials of fixed degrees whose
coefficients depend continuously on a parameter `x`. Suppose that the number of distinct complex
roots of each member is locally nonincreasing and that the degree of the gcd of every pair of
distinct members is locally constant. The family matching lemma
`Polynomial.eventually_exists_bijOn_biUnion_roots_toFinset` then shows that the product of the
members has a locally constant number of distinct complex roots, so the results of
`TauCeti/Analysis/Polynomial/RealRoots/Ordered.lean` apply to the product.

On a nonempty preconnected base this gives a single finite list of continuous, strictly increasing
functions enumerating, at every parameter, the real roots of all the members together, such that
the multiplicity of each listed root in each member is the same at every parameter. In particular
membership of a listed root in the root set of each member does not depend on the parameter. This
is the common ordered list of real roots over which a delineable family is stacked.

## Main results

* `Polynomial.eventually_card_aroots_prod_eq`: the product of the members has locally constant
  number of distinct complex roots.
* `Polynomial.exists_continuous_ordered_common_roots_of_preconnectedSpace`: the common ordered list
  of real roots with constant multiplicities in every member.

/-- **Family matching lemma for real polynomials.** Let `F k x` be real polynomials of degree
`d k` near `x₀`, for `k` in a finite index type, whose coefficients of index at most `d k` are
continuous at `x₀`. Suppose that near `x₀` no member has more distinct complex roots than at `x₀`,
and that the degree of the gcd of every pair of distinct members is the same as at `x₀`. Then for
`x` near `x₀` there is a single bijection `e` from the distinct complex roots of all the `F k x₀`
onto those of all the `F k x` that moves each root by less than `ε` and preserves its multiplicity
in every member. -/
