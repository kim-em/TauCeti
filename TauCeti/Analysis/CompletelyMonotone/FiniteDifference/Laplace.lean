# The Hausdorff--Bernstein--Widder theorem in finite-difference form

Bernstein's theorem in the form
`TauCeti.exists_representsLaplace_of_isCompletelyMonotone` takes a completely monotone function,
that is a *smooth* one with alternating iterated derivatives, and produces a finite measure on
`ℝ≥0` whose Laplace transform it is. The hypothesis available in applications is the
finite-difference one of `TauCeti.IsDifferenceCompletelyMonotone`, which carries no smoothness:
what one can check about the mass of a family of measures, or about a function built from
positive-definiteness data, is that its mixed forward differences alternate in sign.

This file closes the gap between the two, in both directions.

Feeding the smoothing of
`TauCeti.IsDifferenceCompletelyMonotone.exists_isCompletelyMonotone_between_shift` into Bernstein's
theorem bridges them up to an arbitrarily small shift of the argument: a function on `[0, ∞)`
all of whose mixed forward differences alternate is squeezed, for every `ε > 0`, between
the shift `f (· + ε)` and `f` by the Laplace transform of a finite measure
(`TauCeti.IsDifferenceCompletelyMonotone.exists_isFiniteMeasure_laplaceTransform_between_shift`).

Compactness alone does not remove the shift, because the finite-difference hypothesis says
nothing about the behaviour of `f` at the endpoint: the indicator `f 0 = 1`, `f t = 0` for
`t ≠ 0` has every mixed difference with nonnegative steps of the required sign on `[0, ∞)` —
with all steps positive, the only surviving term of `Δ_{h₁} ⋯ Δ_{hₙ} f` at a point of `[0, ∞)` is
`(-1)ⁿ f 0` at the origin — while no finite positive measure has it as its Laplace transform.
Right-continuity at `0` is enough: it makes the Laplace gaps uniformly small, so Prokhorov gives a
weak cluster point. The squeeze is closed at `0` by the assumed right-continuity and at positive
parameters by continuity of the cluster point's Laplace transform.

For the converse, positive shifts of a continuous completely monotone function satisfy the
finite-difference condition by the smooth equivalence in `FiniteDifference/Basic.lean`; closure
under pointwise limits removes the shift. Applying this to a finite measure's Laplace transform
gives the easy direction.

Together the two directions say that the finite-difference notion plus right-continuity at zero
is *equivalent* to the derivative notion of
`TauCeti.IsContinuousCompletelyMonotoneOnIoi` — no smoothness needs to be assumed, only
concluded. `TauCeti.IsDifferenceCompletelyMonotone.isContinuousCompletelyMonotoneOnIoi` is the
form in which applications use it: `TauCeti.bernsteinMeasureKernel` takes the derivative
predicate as a hypothesis, and the representation API for `TauCeti.bernsteinMeasure` uses it.

/-! ## Approximate representation from the finite-difference hypothesis -/

/-- **Approximate Bernstein representation.** A function that is completely monotone in the
finite-difference sense is squeezed, for every `ε > 0`, between
`f (· + ε)` and `f` by the Laplace transform of a finite positive measure on `ℝ≥0`.

A Bernstein representation of `f` itself does not follow from these measures by compactness
alone: the hypothesis leaves the value at the endpoint free, so it needs right-continuity of `f`
at `0`, which is what
`TauCeti.exists_representsLaplace_of_isDifferenceCompletelyMonotone_of_continuousWithinAt`
adds. -/

/-- **The approximating measures of a finite-difference completely monotone function that is

large ball is bounded, by
`TauCeti.measure_compl_closedBall_le_sub_laplaceTransform_div`, by its Laplace gap
`μ.real univ - laplaceTransform μ x`, and the squeeze bounds that gap by `f 0 - f (x + aₙ)`.
Choosing `x` so small that `f` has barely dropped by `2x` makes the estimate uniform over all
shifts `aₙ ≤ x`; the finitely many larger shifts are handled by
`TauCeti.isTightMeasureSet_range_of_finite`. -/
