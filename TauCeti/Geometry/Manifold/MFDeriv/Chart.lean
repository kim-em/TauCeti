# A manifold derivative read in arbitrary charts

A map `f : M → M'` with manifold derivative `f'` at `x'` becomes, in the extended charts centred at
any `x` and `y` whose sources contain `x'` and `f x'`, a map between model vector spaces. Its
Fréchet derivative within `range I` is `f'` conjugated by the derivatives of the two charts.
Mathlib's `mdifferentiableAt_iff_of_mem_source` records differentiability in such charts, but not
the value of the derivative. Change-of-variables arguments on a manifold need that value, because
they integrate the absolute Jacobian determinant of `f` read in fixed charts.

For a map into a normed space on a boundaryless manifold, the coordinate expression in the
preferred extended chart at `x` is an honest function on the model space, `C^n` or differentiable
whenever `f` is, and its Fréchet derivative at the chart image of `x` is the vector-valued
manifold derivative `mvfderiv I f x`. This is how critical points defined through the preferred
chart, as in Morse theory, are identified with the zeros of `mvfderiv`.

## Main results

* `HasMFDerivAt.hasFDerivWithinAt_of_mem_source`: the derivative of `f` read in the extended
  charts at `x` and `y`.
* `TauCeti.mfderiv_eq_fderiv_comp_mfderiv_extChartAt` and
  `TauCeti.fderiv_comp_extChartAt_symm_injective`: for a map into a normed space, the manifold
  derivative at any point of a chart's source, in terms of the Fréchet derivative of the
  coordinate expression, and the resulting transfer of injectivity.
* `ContMDiffAt.contDiffAt_comp_extChartAt_symm` and
  `MDifferentiableAt.differentiableAt_comp_extChartAt_symm`: on a boundaryless manifold, the
  coordinate expression of a `C^n` (resp. differentiable) map into a normed space is `C^n` (resp.
  differentiable) at the chart image of the point.
* `MDifferentiableAt.mvfderiv_eq_fderiv_comp_extChartAt_symm`: on a boundaryless manifold, the
  vector-valued manifold derivative is the Fréchet derivative of the coordinate expression.
* `TauCeti.writtenInExtChartAt_chartAt_comp_eventuallyEq`, `TauCeti.hasMFDerivAt_chartAt_comp` and
  `TauCeti.contMDiffAt_chartAt_comp`: for a space charted over a charted space `X`, with the
  composite charts, the preferred `X`-valued chart at `x` reads as the identity near `x`, so it is
  smooth at `x` with the identity as its derivative there.
