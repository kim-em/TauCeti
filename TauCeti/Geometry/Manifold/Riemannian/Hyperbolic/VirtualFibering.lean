# The virtual fibering conjecture

Thurston asked whether every hyperbolic 3-manifold has a finite cover that is a surface bundle
over the circle (Kirby's problem 3.51). For closed manifolds this was proved by Agol. This file
states it: every compact connected smooth 3-manifold without boundary that admits a hyperbolic
metric (`TauCeti.IsHyperbolic`) is virtually fibered (`TauCeti.IsVirtuallyFibered`).

A closed 3-manifold is modelled here on `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 3)` with the boundaryless model
`𝓡 3`, and is compact and connected. The `[MetricSpace M]` hypothesis supplies the ambient
metric structure required by this statement, while a `HyperbolicMetric` witness carries its own
Riemannian metric for the completeness field. Orientability is not assumed; Agol's theorem
covers non-orientable manifolds by passing to the orientation double cover.

The conclusion asks for a finite cover homeomorphic to a mapping torus, the topological form of a
fibration over the circle recorded by `TauCeti.FibersOverCircle`. A surface bundle over the circle
is the mapping torus of its monodromy, so Agol's theorem gives this conclusion.

The conjecture is stated, not proved.
