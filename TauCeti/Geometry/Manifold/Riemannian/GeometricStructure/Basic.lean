# Geometric structures modelled on Thurston's eight geometries

A space `M` has a *geometric structure* modelled on one of Thurston's eight geometries `G`, with
model space `X = G.Space`, when `M` is homeomorphic to an orbit space `X / Γ` of a subgroup `Γ` of
the full isometry group `Isom X` acting freely and properly discontinuously on `X`. This is the
notion in the statement of the geometrization theorem: each piece of the prime and torus
decomposition of a closed orientable 3-manifold admits a geometric structure.

Thurston and Scott equivalently describe a geometric structure as a complete `(Isom X, X)`-structure
on `M`, that is, a complete locally homogeneous metric locally isometric to `X`. Every model space
`X` is simply connected, so the developing map of a complete structure identifies `M` with such a
quotient `X / Γ`; the quotient description is therefore taken as the definition here. In the other
direction, the orbit space `X / Γ` carries the `(Isom X, X)`-atlas pushed forward from `X`
(`TauCeti.hasGroupoid_smulGroupoid_quotient_subgroup`), so a space with a geometric structure is an
`(Isom X, X)`-manifold (`TauCeti.HasGeometricStructure.exists_hasGroupoid`). In particular it is a
smooth manifold and inherits a Riemannian metric from `X`
(`TauCeti.Geometry.Manifold.Riemannian.SMulGroupoid`).

The structure is defined for a topological space `M`, up to homeomorphism. For 3-manifolds this
agrees with the smooth notion, since by Moise's theorem every topological 3-manifold has a smooth
structure, unique up to diffeomorphism.

As a first family of examples, every three-dimensional lens space `L(m; ℓ₀, ℓ₁)` is a spherical
manifold: its lens group acts on the unit sphere of `ℂ²` by unitary rotations, which a real linear
isometry `ℂ² ≃ ℝ⁴` turns into isometries of the round three-sphere.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.HasGeometricStructure M G`: `M` is homeomorphic to `G.Space / Γ` for a subgroup `Γ` of
  `Isom G.Space` acting freely and properly discontinuously.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.hasGeometricStructure_iff_exists_isQuotientMap`: a geometric structure is a quotient map
  `G.Space → M` whose fibres are the orbits of such a subgroup.
* `TauCeti.hasGeometricStructure_quotient` and `TauCeti.hasGeometricStructure_space`: every such
  orbit space, and in particular the model space itself, has a geometric structure.
* `Homeomorph.hasGeometricStructure_iff`: having a geometric structure is invariant under
  homeomorphism.
* `TauCeti.HasGeometricStructure.exists_hasGroupoid`: a space with a geometric structure is an
  `(Isom X, X)`-manifold.
* `TauCeti.LensSpace.hasGeometricStructure_spherical`: three-dimensional lens spaces are spherical
  manifolds.
