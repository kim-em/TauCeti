# The PL structure groupoid

Mathlib builds a manifold out of a `StructureGroupoid` on the model space: `contDiffGroupoid n I`
for smooth manifolds, `continuousGroupoid H` for topological ones. Between the two sits the
piecewise-linear structure, and Mathlib has nothing for it. This file supplies it, in the same
shape as `contDiffGroupoid`: a `Pregroupoid` whose property is "PL when read in the model through
`I`", and the `StructureGroupoid` it generates.

Given a model with corners `I : ModelWithCorners ℝ E H`, a map `f : H → H` is declared PL on
`s : Set H` when `I ∘ f ∘ I.symm` is piecewise linear (`TauCeti.IsPLOn`) on
`I.symm ⁻¹' s ∩ range I`. Reading the property in the model this way — exactly as
`contDiffPregroupoid` does — is what makes the definition apply verbatim to the half-space and
quadrant models, so PL manifolds with boundary and with corners come out of the same definition as
boundaryless ones, with no separate half-space predicate.

A *PL manifold* is then a charted space `M` over `H` with `HasGroupoid M (PLGroupoid I)`. No new
structure is introduced for it, matching Mathlib's treatment of `IsManifold`.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.PLPregroupoid`: the pregroupoid of maps of `H` that are PL read in the model.
* `TauCeti.PLGroupoid`: the structure groupoid of PL open partial homeomorphisms of `H`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.PLGroupoid_le_continuousGroupoid`: the forgetful inclusion "PL implies Top".
* `TauCeti.ofSet_mem_PLGroupoid` and the `ClosedUnderRestriction (PLGroupoid I)` instance: the
  identity of an open set is PL, so the groupoid is closed under restriction. `HasGroupoid` does
  not itself ask for this, but the standard constructions downstream of it do — restricting a
  chart to an open subset (`StructureGroupoid.restr_mem_maximalAtlas`) and the charted-space
  structure an open subset inherits (`TopologicalSpace.Opens.instHasGroupoid`) both take
  `ClosedUnderRestriction` as an instance argument.

There is deliberately no inclusion in the other direction against `contDiffGroupoid`: a smooth
transition map is not literally piecewise affine, and the comparison between the smooth and the PL
structures is the Whitehead smoothing theory, not a containment of groupoids.

This is the structure-group track of layer 1 of the geometric-topology roadmap
(`TauCetiRoadmap/GeometricTopology/README.md`).

The PL groupoid of the trivial model on `ℝ` contains a homeomorphism that agrees with no affine
map. So `TauCeti.PLGroupoid` is strictly larger than the groupoid of affine transition maps, and
the definition above is not a roundabout way of asking for affineness. -/
