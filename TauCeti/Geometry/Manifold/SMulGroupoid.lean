# (G, X)-manifolds

Let a group `G` act on a topological space `X` by homeomorphisms. Thurston's pseudogroup generated
by `G` consists of the homeomorphisms between open subsets of `X` that agree, near each point of
their domain, with the action of some element of `G`. In Mathlib's language this is a structure
groupoid on `X`, `TauCeti.smulGroupoid G X`, built from the pregroupoid
`TauCeti.smulPregroupoid G X` exactly as `contDiffGroupoid` and `conformalGroupoid` are built from
theirs.

A *(G, X)-manifold* is then a charted space `M` over `X` whose transition maps lie in this groupoid,
that is `[ChartedSpace X M] [HasGroupoid M (smulGroupoid G X)]`; no new structure is introduced.
Specialising `(G, X)` gives the classical geometric structures: Euclidean manifolds for the
isometries of Euclidean space, spherical manifolds for the orthogonal group acting on the sphere,
and hyperbolic manifolds for the isometries of hyperbolic space.

Two results connect this notion to the rest of the manifold library.

* If `X` is a `C^n` manifold modelled on `I` and `G` acts by `C^n` maps, then a (G, X)-manifold is
  a `C^n` manifold for the charts obtained by composing its `X`-valued charts with the charts of
  `X` (`TauCeti.isManifold_of_hasGroupoid_smulGroupoid`). So geometric structures are in
  particular smooth structures.
* The orbit space `X / Γ` of a free, properly discontinuous action of a group `Γ`, with the charts
  of `MulAction.instChartedSpaceQuotient`, is a (Γ, X)-manifold
  (`TauCeti.hasGroupoid_smulGroupoid_quotient`), and a (G, X)-manifold when `Γ` is a subgroup of
  `G` (`TauCeti.hasGroupoid_smulGroupoid_quotient_subgroup`). This is the source of (G, X)-manifolds
  of the form `X / Γ`. More generally, the charts pushed forward along a surjective local
  homeomorphism `X → M` whose deck transformations are locally given by `G` form a (G, X)-atlas
  (`IsLocalHomeomorph.hasGroupoid_smulGroupoid_chartedSpaceOfRightInverse`).

The deck-transformation hypothesis has the shape of the one in
`IsLocalHomeomorph.isManifold_chartedSpaceOfRightInverse`
(`TauCeti/Geometry/Manifold/Instances/Quotient.lean`), where the deck transformations are only
required to be `C^n`. The developing map and completeness of a (G, X)-structure are not treated
here.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.smulPregroupoid G X`: maps of `X` that agree near each point of a set with the action of
  an element of `G`.
* `TauCeti.smulGroupoid G X`: the structure groupoid of open partial homeomorphisms of `X` that are
  locally given by the action of `G`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.mem_smulGroupoid_iff`: an open partial homeomorphism lies in `smulGroupoid G X` as soon
  as it is locally given by the action of `G`; the inverse is then automatically of the same kind.
* `TauCeti.hasGroupoid_smulGroupoid_iff`: a charted space over `X` is a (G, X)-manifold exactly
  when its transition maps are locally given by the action of `G`.
* `TauCeti.exists_smul_eventuallyEq_chartAt`: near each point of its source, a chart of a
  (G, X)-manifold is the preferred chart there followed by the action of an element of `G`.
* `TauCeti.smulGroupoid_le`: a group whose action is realised by another group's action gives a
  smaller groupoid.
* `TauCeti.contMDiffOn_of_mem_smulGroupoid`: for an action by `C^n` maps, every member of
  `smulGroupoid G X` is `C^n` on its source.
* `TauCeti.isManifold_of_hasGroupoid_smulGroupoid`: a (G, X)-manifold is a `C^n` manifold when `G`
  acts by `C^n` maps on the `C^n` manifold `X`.
* `TauCeti.hasGroupoid_smulGroupoid_quotient`: the orbit space of a free, properly discontinuous
  action of `Γ` on `X` is a (Γ, X)-manifold.
