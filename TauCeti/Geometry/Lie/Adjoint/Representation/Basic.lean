# The group adjoint representation

This file bundles the group adjoint `Ad` as a continuous representation on
left-invariant derivations. It transports operator-valued smoothness across the canonical
isometric identification between left-invariant derivations and the tangent space at the identity,
then derives joint smoothness of the action by evaluation.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.Lie.continuousAdjointRepresentation`: the group adjoint as a continuous representation.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Lie.contMDiff_Ad_apply`: the joint action `(g, X) ↦ Ad g X` is smooth.
* `TauCeti.Lie.contMDiff_continuousAdjointRepresentation`: the bounded-operator-valued
  representation is smooth.
