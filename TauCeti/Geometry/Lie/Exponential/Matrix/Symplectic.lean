# Matrix exponential lines in the symplectic group

This file identifies the real matrices whose whole exponential line lies in the symplectic matrix
group: they are exactly the elements of the symplectic Lie algebra
`LieAlgebra.Symplectic.sp l ℝ`. It is the symplectic companion of the orthogonal characterization
in `TauCeti/Geometry/Lie/Exponential/Matrix/SpecialOrthogonal.lean`.

Both directions run through the conjugated form `Aᵀ = J * (-A) * J⁻¹` of skew-adjointness, since
that is the shape the exponential transports: it becomes `(exp A)ᵀ = J * (exp A)⁻¹ * J⁻¹`, which is
the symplectic condition. Conversely the symplectic condition holds along the whole line, so the
exponential lines of `Aᵀ` and of `J * (-A) * J⁻¹` coincide and their generators agree.

Because a symplectic matrix has determinant one (Mathlib's `SymplecticGroup.det_eq_one`), the
exponential of an element of `sp` lands in the special linear group as well.

## Main results

* `Matrix.exp_mem_symplecticGroup_of_mem_sp`: the exponential of an element of the symplectic Lie
  algebra is symplectic.
* `Matrix.det_exp_eq_one_of_mem_sp`: that exponential has determinant one.
* `Matrix.forall_exp_smul_mem_symplecticGroup_iff_mem_sp`: a real matrix generates a
  one-parameter subgroup of the symplectic group exactly when it lies in the symplectic Lie
  algebra.
