# Semialgebraic functions

A function between coordinate spaces is semialgebraic on a set when its domain and graph are
semialgebraic.  The graph is regarded as a subset of the coordinate space indexed by the disjoint
union of the input and output coordinates.  Requiring the specified domain to be semialgebraic is
useful before projection closure is available: semialgebraicity of a graph alone does not yet let
us recover its projection onto the input coordinates.

This file gives the graph predicate its basic API.  It proves restriction, congruence, and
piecewise-gluing laws and shows that polynomial maps are semialgebraic.  It deliberately does not
assert closure under arbitrary composition, whose graph generally requires eliminating the
intermediate coordinates; images, inverse images, and composition are derived from projection
closure in `TauCeti.Geometry.RealAlgebraic.Semialgebraic.Image`.
