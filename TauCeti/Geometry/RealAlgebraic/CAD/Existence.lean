# Existence of adapted cylindrical algebraic decompositions

For every finite set `F` of real polynomials in `n` variables there is a cylindrical algebraic
decomposition of `ℝ ^ n` adapted to `F`: every member of `F` is sign-invariant on every cell
(`TauCeti.exists_isCAD_signInvariant`).

The proof is by induction on `n`. Single out the first variable with `MvPolynomial.finSuccEquiv`
and take an adapted CAD of `ℝ ^ n` for the Collins projection of the resulting family.
By Collins delineability, the family has a delineation over each cell. Its stacks give the CAD
of `ℝ ^ (n + 1)`.

These stacks are semialgebraic by `TauCeti.Delineation.isSemialgebraicStack`: their sections
and sectors are described by membership in the shared distinct root set and the number of
shared roots below the height. No derivatives need to be added to the input family.
Nullified members, repeated roots, the empty family and stacks without sections are included.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.exists_isCAD_signInvariant`: every finite set of polynomials has an adapted CAD.
* `TauCeti.HasSemialgebraicProjections ℝ`: **projection closure**, the Tarski–Seidenberg theorem.
  Forgetting the coordinate `0` maps semialgebraic subsets of `ℝ ^ (n + 1)` to semialgebraic
  subsets of `ℝ ^ n` (`TauCeti.HasSemialgebraicProjections.isSemialgebraic_image_tail`). A
  semialgebraic set is a sign condition on finitely many polynomials, so it is a union of cells
  of an adapted CAD, and its projection is a union of cells of the projected CAD. With this
  instance the results of `TauCeti.Geometry.RealAlgebraic.Semialgebraic.QuantifierElimination` and
  `TauCeti.Geometry.RealAlgebraic.Semialgebraic.Image` apply to `ℝ`.
* `TauCeti.exists_finite_image_sign_eval_eq`: finitely many sample points realize every sign
  vector of a finite family of polynomials.
