# The Collins projection set

For a finite family `F` of univariate polynomials over a commutative ring `R`, the Collins
projection `F.collinsProjection` is a finite subset of `R`. Write `T` for the set of all reducta
of all members of `F`. The projection contains

* every coefficient `r.coeff i`, `i ≤ r.natDegree`, of every `r ∈ T`;
* every principal subresultant coefficient of `r` and `r.derivative` for `r ∈ T`;
* every principal subresultant coefficient of `r` and `s` for `r, s ∈ T`,

where the principal subresultant coefficients are taken at the actual degrees of the reducta,
at every index from zero through the smaller of the two degrees. Zero and constant entries, and
pairs coming from the same member of `F`, are retained: this gives a simple finite superset of
Collins' projection which needs no preprocessing of the family.

The intended coefficient ring is `R = MvPolynomial (Fin n) A`, so that `F` is a family of
polynomials in one distinguished variable over the base coordinates. Specializing the base
coordinates is a ring homomorphism `φ : R →+* S`, and it can lower degrees. Truncation and
principal coefficients are taken *before* specialization, and the reducta account for every
possible drop in degree. The coefficients of `p.map φ` are the images of the coefficients of
`p`, which lie in the projection, and the specialization lemmas below show that the principal
subresultant coefficients of the specialized polynomials, at their actual specialized degrees,
are also images under `φ` of elements of the projection. Thus the signs of the projection at a
base point determine the degrees of the specialized polynomials and, through the subresultant
gcd criterion, the degrees of their pairwise gcds and of their gcds with their derivatives; this
is how the projection enters Collins' delineability theorem. The last section of this file
proves this: whenever the same elements of the projection vanish under two specializations
`φ : R →+* K` and `ψ : R →+* L` into fields (for instance evaluation at two points of a base set
on which the projection is sign-invariant), the specialized family has the same degrees, the same
nullified members, the same pairwise gcd degrees and the same gcd degrees with derivatives.

## Main definitions and results

* `Finset.collinsProjection`: the Collins projection set of a finite family.
* `Finset.mem_collinsProjection`: the explicit description of its elements.
* `Finset.collinsProjection_mono`: the projection is monotone in the family.
* `Finset.collinsProjection_image_map`: an injective coefficient map commutes with projection.
* `Finset.collinsProjection_image_finSuccEquiv'_map`,
  `Finset.collinsProjection_image_finSuccEquiv_map`: for a family of polynomials in `n + 1`
  variables, singling out a variable and projecting commutes with an injective coefficient map.
  In particular the projection of a family with integer coefficients, viewed over `ℝ`, is the
  image of the projection computed entirely over `ℤ`.
* `Finset.psc_map_mem_image_collinsProjection`,
  `Finset.psc_map_derivative_mem_image_collinsProjection`: principal subresultant coefficients
  of specialized polynomials, at the specialized degrees, come from the projection.
* `Finset.natDegree_map_eq_of_collinsProjection`, `Finset.map_eq_zero_iff_of_collinsProjection`:
  two specializations under which the same elements of the projection vanish give every member
  of the family the same degree, and nullify the same members.
* `Finset.natDegree_gcd_map_eq_of_collinsProjection`,
  `Finset.natDegree_gcd_map_derivative_eq_of_collinsProjection`: under the same hypothesis, the
  specialized pairwise gcds, and the specialized gcds of each member with its derivative, have
  the same degrees.
* `Finset.card_roots_toFinset_map_eq_of_collinsProjection`: over algebraically closed fields of
  characteristic zero, each specialized member then has the same number of distinct roots.
