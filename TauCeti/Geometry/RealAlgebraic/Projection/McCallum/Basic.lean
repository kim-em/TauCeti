# The McCallum projection set

Let `F` be a finite family of polynomials in one distinguished variable over a commutative ring
`R` with a normalized gcd, and let `B` be a basis of `F`: in McCallum's setting, a finite set of
primitive, squarefree, pairwise coprime polynomials of positive degree whose products of powers
recover the members of `F` up to their contents. The McCallum projection `F.mcCallumProjection B`
is the finite subset of `R` consisting of

* the content `f.content` of every member `f ∈ F`;
* every coefficient `b.coeff i`, `i ≤ b.natDegree`, of every member `b ∈ B`;
* the discriminant `b.discr` of every member `b ∈ B`;
* the resultant `resultant b b'` of every pair of distinct members `b, b' ∈ B`, in both orders
  (which differ only by a sign).

The intended coefficient ring is `R = MvPolynomial (Fin n) ℝ` with `B` an irreducible basis of
`F` (`Finset.IsIrreducibleBasis`). Mathlib fixes no normalization on `MvPolynomial`; any
`NormalizedGCDMonoid` structure may be chosen, and changing it changes each content only by a
unit factor.

Unlike the Collins projection `Finset.collinsProjection`, no reducta and no subresultant
coefficients beyond resultants and discriminants are taken. McCallum proves that this smaller set
suffices for lifting over a base cell on which every element of the projection is
order-invariant (rather than merely sign-invariant) and no member of the basis is nullified. The
contents are always included, so that information about the members of `F` is not lost when
passing to the basis.

The projection depends on the choice of basis only up to associates: two irreducible bases of
the same family give projections whose elements are associated to one another
(`Finset.IsIrreducibleBasis.exists_associated_mem_mcCallumProjection`). Since associated
multivariate polynomials over a field differ by a nonzero constant factor, whether every element
of the projection is sign-invariant, or order-invariant, on a set does not depend on the basis.

Specializing the base coordinates is a ring homomorphism `φ : R →+* A`. The last section shows
that the zero pattern of the projection under a specialization fixes the degrees and the
nullified members of both the basis and the family: if the same elements of the projection
vanish under `φ` and `ψ`, then every member of the basis, and every member of the family, has the
same degree after either specialization, and is nullified by `φ` exactly when it is nullified by
`ψ`.

The discriminant of the product of any subfamily of an irreducible basis has constant
ambient order wherever the projection does
(`Finset.IsIrreducibleBasis.orderAt_discr_prod_eq_of_mcCallumProjection`). Together with
`Finset.IsIrreducibleBasis.discr_prod_ne_zero`, this supplies the discriminant hypotheses
for applying a single-polynomial delineability theorem to the active basis product.

## Main definitions and results

* `Finset.mcCallumProjection`: the McCallum projection of a family with respect to a basis.
* `Finset.mem_mcCallumProjection`: the explicit description of its elements.
* `Finset.mcCallumProjection_mono`: the projection is monotone in the family and the basis.
* `Finset.IsIrreducibleBasis.exists_associated_mem_mcCallumProjection`: independence of the
  basis up to associates.
* `Finset.natDegree_map_eq_of_mcCallumProjection`, `Finset.map_eq_zero_iff_of_mcCallumProjection`:
  two specializations under which the same elements of the projection vanish give every member
  of the basis the same degree, and nullify the same members of the basis.
* `Finset.IsIrreducibleBasis.natDegree_map_eq_of_mcCallumProjection`,
  `Finset.IsIrreducibleBasis.map_eq_zero_iff_of_mcCallumProjection`: the same for the members of
  the family, when the basis is an irreducible basis.
