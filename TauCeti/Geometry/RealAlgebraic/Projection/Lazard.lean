# The Lazard projection set

Let `F` be a finite family of polynomials in one distinguished variable over a commutative ring
`R` with a normalized gcd, and let `B` be a basis of `F`, in Lazard's setting an irreducible basis
(`Finset.IsIrreducibleBasis`): a finite set of pairwise nonassociated irreducible polynomials of
positive degree whose products of powers recover the members of `F` up to their contents. The
Lazard projection `F.lazardProjection B` is the finite subset of `R` consisting of

* the content `f.content` of every member `f ∈ F`;
* the leading coefficient `b.leadingCoeff` and the trailing coefficient `b.trailingCoeff` of every
  member `b ∈ B`;
* the discriminant `b.discr` of every member `b ∈ B`;
* the resultant `resultant b b'` of every pair of distinct members `b, b' ∈ B`, in both orders
  (which differ only by a sign).

The trailing coefficient is Mathlib's `Polynomial.trailingCoeff`, the coefficient of the lowest
power of the distinguished variable occurring in `b`; it is the constant coefficient `b.coeff 0`
unless the distinguished variable divides `b`.

The intended coefficient ring is `R = MvPolynomial (Fin n) ℝ`. Compared with the McCallum
projection `Finset.mcCallumProjection`, only the leading and trailing coefficients of each basis
member are kept, rather than all of its coefficients
(`Finset.lazardProjection_subset_mcCallumProjection`). In exchange, the lifting theorem of
McCallum, Parusiński and Paunescu asks for invariance of Lazard valuations instead of orders of
vanishing, and allows nullification of basis members.

For an irreducible basis over a domain of characteristic zero, no element of the Lazard projection
vanishes unless the family itself contains the zero polynomial
(`Finset.IsIrreducibleBasis.zero_mem_lazardProjection_iff`). In particular the discriminant,
leading coefficient and trailing coefficient of every member of the basis are nonzero formal
polynomials in the base coordinates, as the lifting theorem requires, even though they may vanish
at points of a base cell. As for McCallum's projection, the Lazard projection depends on the choice
of irreducible basis only up to associates
(`Finset.IsIrreducibleBasis.exists_associated_mem_lazardProjection`).

## Main definitions and results

* `Finset.lazardProjection`: the Lazard projection of a family with respect to a basis.
* `Finset.mem_lazardProjection`: the explicit description of its elements.
* `Finset.lazardProjection_mono`: the projection is monotone in the family and the basis.
* `Finset.lazardProjection_subset_mcCallumProjection`: the Lazard projection is contained in the
  McCallum projection.
* `Finset.IsIrreducibleBasis.exists_associated_mem_lazardProjection`: independence of the basis
  up to associates.
* `Finset.IsIrreducibleBasis.zero_mem_lazardProjection_iff`: in characteristic zero, the Lazard
  projection of an irreducible basis contains `0` exactly when the family does.

every element of the Lazard projection with respect to `B'` is associated to an element of the
Lazard projection with respect to `B`. -/

/-- **Nonvanishing of the Lazard projection.** In characteristic zero, the Lazard projection of
an irreducible basis contains `0` exactly when the family contains the zero polynomial. Thus for
a family of nonzero polynomials, the contents of its members and the leading coefficients,
trailing coefficients, discriminants and pairwise resultants of the basis are all nonzero. -/
