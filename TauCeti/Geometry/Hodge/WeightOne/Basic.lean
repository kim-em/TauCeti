# Effective Hodge structures of weight one

An effective pure Hodge structure of weight one has only the two Hodge components
`H^{1,0}` and `H^{0,1}`. Its Weil operator acts on them by `i` and `-i`, respectively, and
therefore descends to an almost complex structure on the real form fixed by conjugation.

This file identifies the `i`- and `-i`-eigenspaces of the Weil operator with `H^{1,0}` and
`H^{0,1}`. It then transfers those identifications to the scalar extension of the real almost
complex structure constructed in `TauCeti.Geometry.Hodge.WeilOperator`. In weight one without
effectivity, the two eigenspaces aggregate all Hodge components according to their first index
modulo two.

Conversely, an almost complex structure on a real vector space determines an effective pure Hodge
structure of weight one on its complexification. Its Hodge components are the `i`- and
`-i`-eigenspaces of the complex-linear extension, and its Weil operator is that extension.

The real form and its structure map are the generic constructions `TauCeti.realPoints` and
`TauCeti.realPointsLift`; `TauCeti.realPointsEquiv` identifies its complexification with the
original complex vector space. The almost-complex structure reuses
`TauCeti.AlmostComplexStructure`, rather than introducing a Hodge-specific copy of that notion.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.Hodge.HodgeStructureOn.eigenspace_weilOperator_I` and
  `TauCeti.Hodge.HodgeStructureOn.eigenspace_weilOperator_neg_I`: for an effective structure, the
  two eigenspaces of the Weil operator are the two Hodge components.
* `TauCeti.Hodge.HodgeStructureOn.eigenspace_baseChange_realAlmostComplexStructure_I` and
  `TauCeti.Hodge.HodgeStructureOn.eigenspace_baseChange_realAlmostComplexStructure_neg_I`: the same
  comparison on the literal complexification of the real form.
* `TauCeti.AlmostComplexStructure.hodgeStructure`: the effective weight-one Hodge structure
  associated with an almost complex structure.
* `TauCeti.AlmostComplexStructure.hodgeStructure_weilOperator`: its Weil operator is the
  complexification of the original almost complex structure.
The construction and conventions follow Voisin, *Hodge Theory and Complex Algebraic Geometry I*,
§6, and Peters--Steenbrink, *Mixed Hodge Structures*, §2.
