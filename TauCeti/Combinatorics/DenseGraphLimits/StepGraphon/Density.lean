# Approximating a graphon by a finite weighted graph

Frieze--Kannan weak regularity approximates a graphon in **cut norm** by the block averages of a
measurable finite partition.  This file turns that into an approximation in **cut distance** by a
finite object: the block matrix of the approximating step graphon, read as a graphon on the
discrete probability space of its blocks.

The cut distance never increases along a measure-preserving pullback (`cutDist_comap_right`), and a
step graphon *is* the pullback of its block matrix along the part-index map, so a step graphon and
its finite matrix are at cut distance zero.  Step graphons are therefore dense in the cut metric,
and so are finite weighted graphs on a vertex set whose size depends only on the accuracy.  Rounding
the two weightings of such a finite weighted graph onto a grid, so that finitely many candidates
remain, is `TauCeti.Combinatorics.DenseGraphLimits.CutMetric.OfMatrixGrid`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.exists_stepGraphon_cutDist_le` -- every graphon is within `ε` in cut
  distance of a step graphon on a measurable finite partition with at most `4 ^ (⌈1/ε²⌉ + 1)` parts;
* `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.exists_ofMatrix_cutDist_le` -- every graphon is within `ε` in cut
  distance of a finite weighted graph on any vertex set of size at least `4 ^ (⌈1/ε²⌉ + 1)`.

/-- **Every graphon is within `ε` in cut distance of a finite weighted graph**, on any vertex set
of size at least the Frieze--Kannan bound `4 ^ (⌈1 / ε²⌉ + 1)`: the block matrix of a Frieze--Kannan
approximation, carrying the block measures as vertex weights.

The vertex weights are the pushforward of `μ` along the block-index map `g`, so they are the
measures of the blocks; vertices beyond the blocks carry weight zero.  Allowing any large enough
vertex set, rather than exactly the number of blocks, keeps the carrier of the approximation
independent of the graphon. -/
