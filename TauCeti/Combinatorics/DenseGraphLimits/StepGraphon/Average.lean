# Block-averaged step graphons

This file specializes `stepGraphon` to the matrix of averages of a graphon over the rectangles
of a measurable finite partition.  This is the step graphon used by the Frieze--Kannan weak
regularity argument: on a block `p ×ˢ q`, its value is the Mathlib set average of the original
graphon over that block.

The set-average convention matters for strict graphon representatives.  A nonempty partition
part may have measure zero, and Mathlib assigns average zero to a null rectangle.  Thus
`stepGraphonAvg` is everywhere `[0, 1]`-valued without choosing arbitrary values on null blocks.
The block-integral theorem below shows that this convention does not change any weighted block
contribution.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.blockAverage` is the matrix of rectangle averages;
* `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.stepGraphonAvg` is the block-average step graphon.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.stepGraphonAvg_def` identifies it as the step graphon of
  `blockAverage`;
* `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.stepGraphonAvg_apply` is its pointwise block formula;
* `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.stepGraphonAvg_apply_of_measure_eq_zero_left` and
  `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.stepGraphonAvg_apply_of_measure_eq_zero_right` record the null-cell
  convention;
* `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.stepGraphonAvg_rectIntegral` says block averaging preserves the
  integral on every partition rectangle;
* `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.stepGraphonAvg_idem` says block averaging is strictly idempotent;
* `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.stepGraphonAvg_stepGraphon_apply` verifies that a non-null constant
  block is recovered exactly.
