# Computed examples of finite graph graphons

This file verifies the DenseGraphLimits roadmap's computed-value backstops for finite graph
graphons: `t(K₂, W_{K₄}) = 3/4` and `t(K₃, W_{C₅}) = 0`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.homDensity_top_two_finiteGraphGraphon_top_four` — the edge density of
  `K₄`;
* `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.homDensity_top_three_finiteGraphGraphon_cycleGraph_five` — `C₅` is
  triangle-free.

## References

* Roadmap: `TauCetiRoadmap/DenseGraphLimits/README.md`, *Worked examples (acceptance gates)*.

/-- **The edge density of `K₄`.** `t(K₂, W_{K₄}) = 3/4`: of the `16` ordered pairs of vertices of
the complete graph on four vertices, the `12` with distinct entries are adjacent.

The roadmap's backstop value at the end of the pipeline: it pins the homomorphism count `12`, the
`homDensityFin` denominator `4 ^ 2`, and the applicability of the compatibility theorem. The
graphon-side integral and the cell volumes are inherited from that theorem. -/

    homDensity (⊤ : SimpleGraph (Fin 2)) (finiteGraphGraphon (⊤ : SimpleGraph (Fin 4)))
      = 3 / 4 := by

/-- **`C₅` is triangle-free.** `t(K₃, W_{C₅}) = 0`: no map `Fin 3 → Fin 5` sends all three edges of
a triangle to edges of the five-cycle, so the density vanishes exactly rather than approximately. -/
