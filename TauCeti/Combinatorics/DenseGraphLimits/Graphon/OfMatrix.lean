# Graphons given by a matrix on a countable carrier

On a countable discrete probability carrier there is nothing to a graphon beyond a symmetric
`[0, 1]`-valued matrix: measurability is automatic.  `Graphon.ofMatrix` packages such a matrix as a
graphon, with the vertex weights carried by the measure and the edge weights by the matrix.  When
the carrier is finite this is a **weighted graph** in the terminology of the graph-limit
literature, but nothing here needs finiteness.

The point of the construction is that these carriers are the *values* a graphon takes once it has
been coarsened: a graphon whose value at `(x, y)` depends on `x` and `y` only through a measurable
map `g : Ω → κ` into such a carrier is exactly the pullback of a matrix along `g`, which is
`exists_ofMatrix_eq_comap_of_factorsThrough`.  Step graphons are the case where `g` is the
part-index map of a measurable finite partition, so a step graphon is the pullback of its block
matrix and the cut distance to it is a cut distance to a finite object.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.Graphon.ofMatrix` -- the graphon of a symmetric `[0, 1]`-valued matrix
  on a countable discrete probability carrier.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.exists_ofMatrix_eq_comap_of_factorsThrough` -- a graphon whose value
  depends only on the image of its two arguments under a measurable map into a countable discrete
  space is the pullback of a matrix along that map.

/-- The graphon of a symmetric `[0, 1]`-valued matrix `b` on a countable discrete probability
carrier `(κ, ν)`, with `ν` carrying the vertex weights and `b` the edge weights.  For a finite
carrier this is the graphon of a weighted graph.

Nothing has to be checked beyond symmetry and the range constraint: every function out of a
countable discrete space is measurable. -/

/-- A graphon whose value at `(x, y)` depends on `x` and `y` only through a measurable map `g` into
a countable discrete carrier is the pullback along `g` of a matrix on that carrier.  The vertex
weights `ν` are arbitrary: only the underlying function is being rebuilt.

The matrix is existentially quantified because it is only determined on the range of `g`: outside
the range any symmetric completion does, and the one produced here reads the value at an arbitrary
`g`-preimage. -/
