# The map form of the cut distance, and its agreement with the coupling form

The **map form** of the cut distance is the classical one: read both graphons on the canonical
carrier `(I, volume)` through measure-preserving maps, and take the infimum of the cut norm of the
difference of the two pullbacks,

`δ□ᵐᵃᵖ(U, W) = inf { ‖U ∘ (f × f) − W ∘ (g × g)‖□ | f : I → Ω₁, g : I → Ω₂ measure preserving }`.

The main result is that it agrees with the coupling-primary `cutDist` over standard Borel carriers,
`cutDist_eq_cutDistPullback`. This is the design equivalence that justifies taking the coupling
form as primary: nothing is lost by doing so, since on the carriers where the classical definition
is usually stated the two numbers are equal.

**Atoms are allowed.** No atomless hypothesis appears on either carrier, and none is needed. The
inequality `cutDistPullback ≤ cutDist` turns a coupling into a pair of maps by pushing `(I, volume)`
forward onto the coupling itself — a probability measure on the standard Borel space `Ω₁ × Ω₂` —
and `exists_measurePreserving_from_unitInterval` (Janson, Thm A.9) does that with no atomless
hypothesis. That is the whole content of the harder direction: an *arbitrary* coupling, however
atomic, is realized by a pair of measure-preserving maps out of `(I, volume)`, because the pair of
projections of such a realization has the coupling as its joint law. The companion
`CutMetric.Pullback.Validation` module evaluates the map form through the equivalence at a
point-mass coupling, at finitely atomic ones, and at ones mixing an atomic with a continuous
direction; these regressions are what the absence of an atomless hypothesis buys, and each fails to
typecheck for any formulation that assumes one.

**Why the easy direction is easy.** A pair of measure-preserving maps `f, g` out of a common
carrier pushes that carrier forward to a coupling along `x ↦ (f x, g x)`, and the overlaid
difference along that coupling pulls back to the plain difference of pullbacks — this is
`cutDist_le_cutNorm_sub_of_measurePreserving`, already available on an arbitrary common carrier.
Specializing it to `(I, volume)` gives `cutDist ≤ cutDistPullback` outright.

**The junk value.** `cutDistPullback` is an infimum over a set of reals that is empty when a
carrier receives no measure-preserving map from `(I, volume)` at all, and then it is `0` by the
`sInf` convention. The elimination rules — and `cutDist_le_cutDistPullback` through them — carry
standard Borel hypotheses on the two carriers that rule this out (`pullbackCutNorms_nonempty`);
`cutDistPullback_le_cutDist` runs the other way and only needs the product carrier standard Borel,
which is where it applies Thm A.9. The range and common-carrier bounds hold with no such hypothesis
at all: in the empty case they reduce to the corresponding fact about `0`, and in the nonempty case
any witness supplies the required upper bound.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.cutDistPullback` — the infimum, over pairs of measure-preserving maps
  from `(I, volume)` to the two carriers, of the cut norm of the difference of the two pullbacks.

## Main results

* `cutDist_eq_cutDistPullback` — **the coupling and map forms of the cut distance agree** over
  standard Borel carriers, atoms allowed; it is `cutDist_le_cutDistPullback` and
  `cutDistPullback_le_cutDist` together;
* `cutDistPullback_le` and `le_cutDistPullback` are the introduction and elimination rules for the
  infimum, and `exists_measurePreserving_cutNorm_sub_lt` produces a pair of maps beating any strict
  upper bound; `cutDistPullback_def` spells the defining infimum out in public terms;
* `cutDistPullback_comm` is symmetry, and holds with no hypothesis on either carrier;
* `cutDistPullback_congr_ae_left` and `cutDistPullback_congr_ae_right`: the map form only sees the
  almost-everywhere class of each graphon, again with no hypothesis on either carrier;
* `cutDistPullback_nonneg`, `cutDistPullback_le_one`, `cutDistPullback_self` and
  `cutDistPullback_le_cutNorm_sub` are the range and the same-carrier bounds.

/-! ### The two forms agree -/

/-- **A pair of measure-preserving maps bounds the cut distance from above.** This is the easy half
of `cutDist_eq_cutDistPullback`: the graph of `(f, g)` pushes `volume` forward to a coupling, along
which the overlaid difference is exactly the difference of the two pullbacks. -/

/-- **Every coupling is realized by a pair of measure-preserving maps.** This is the substance of
`cutDist_eq_cutDistPullback`.

A coupling `π` of `μ₁` and `μ₂` is a probability measure on `Ω₁ × Ω₂`, so Janson's Thm A.9 gives a
measure-preserving `h : I → Ω₁ × Ω₂`. Its two coordinates are measure preserving onto the two
carriers, and `h` is their pairing, so the overlaid difference along `π` pulls back along `h` to the
difference of the two pullbacks. No atomless hypothesis enters: `π` may be a point mass.

Only the product carrier is assumed standard Borel, which is all Thm A.9 is applied to here; when
both factors are standard Borel — the hypotheses of `cutDist_eq_cutDistPullback` — the instance is
synthesized from them. -/

/-- **The coupling and map forms of the cut distance agree**, over standard Borel carriers, with
atoms allowed.

This is the design equivalence behind the coupling-primary definition: the classical
measure-preserving-map infimum is not more general, so nothing is lost by taking the cross-carrier
coupling form — which needs no hypothesis even to be stated — as the primary object. In particular
the whole `cutDist` API transfers to `cutDistPullback` over standard Borel carriers. -/
