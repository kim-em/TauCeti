# Reading a graphon on the unit interval

Every standard Borel probability space receives a measure-preserving map out of `(I, volume)`
(Janson, Theorem A.9), and the cut distance does not change when a graphon is read along a
measure-preserving map (`cutDist_comap_right`).  Pulling a graphon back along such a map therefore
puts it on the canonical carrier `(I, volume)` at no cost: every graphon on a standard Borel
carrier is at cut distance zero from one on the unit interval, so nothing is lost by working there.

The map is an arbitrary choice, and so is the representative built from it; what is canonical is
its cut class, which is what `cutDist_unitIntervalModel` records.

The standard Borel hypothesis is what the map theorem needs, and this file does not remove it.
The representation theorem for an *arbitrary* probability carrier (Janson, Theorem 7.1) goes
through a countably generated sub-σ-algebra instead, and is not proved here.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.unitIntervalModel` -- the `(I, volume)` representative of a graphon on
  a standard Borel probability carrier.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.cutDist_unitIntervalModel` -- cut distances to a graphon are unchanged
  by reading it on the unit interval;
* `TauCeti.DenseGraphLimits.exists_graphon_unitInterval_cutDist_eq_zero_of_standardBorel` -- every
  graphon on a standard Borel carrier is at cut distance zero from one on the unit interval.

/-- **Every graphon on a standard Borel carrier is at cut distance zero from a graphon on the unit
interval**: the canonical carrier sees every such graphon up to cut distance.

This is the standard Borel case only, the one the map theorem of Janson, Thm A.9 covers; the
arbitrary-carrier representation theorem (Janson, Thm 7.1) is a separate statement. -/
