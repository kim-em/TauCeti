# The bipartite ribbon graph of a permutation triple

A degree-`n` permutation triple and a finite bipartite ribbon graph carry the same information,
and this file builds the graph out of the triple. The edges are the `n` sheets, the black
vertices are the cycles of `σ0` and the white ones the cycles of `σ1` — fixed points included,
so every sheet has exactly one end of each colour — and the cyclic order of the edges around a
vertex is the cycle of the corresponding component through them. For a connected triple the
result is a dessin d'enfants; disconnected triples give disconnected graphs, and
`TauCeti.PermutationTriple.isConnected_ribbonGraph` is the equivalence.

* `TauCeti.PermutationTriple.ribbonGraph`: the construction.
* `TauCeti.PermutationTriple.facePerm_ribbonGraph`: the face permutation of the graph is the
  third component `σinf` of the triple, so the faces of the graph are the cycles of `σinf`.
* `TauCeti.PermutationTriple.isConnected_ribbonGraph`: the graph is connected exactly when the
  triple is, the rotation group of the graph being the monodromy group of the triple.
* `TauCeti.PermutationTriple.eulerChar_ribbonGraph`: the Euler characteristic of the graph,
  counted as `|B| + |W| - |E| + |F|`, is the Euler characteristic of the triple, counted as the
  total number of cycles of the three components less the degree. The two counts agree because
  the black vertices, the white vertices and the faces are precisely the cycles of `σ0`, of `σ1`
  and of `σinf`.

## Implementation notes

The construction is `@[expose]`d. Its edge, black-vertex and white-vertex types are structure
fields of `TauCeti.BipartiteRibbonGraph`, so a consumer cannot so much as state that an edge of
`t.ribbonGraph` is a sheet of `t` without reducing those fields; the lemmas below then read off
the remaining fields.

The black and white vertex types are quotients of `Fin n`. Their `Fintype` and `DecidableEq`
instances decide `Equiv.Perm.SameCycle` by iterating the permutation, so the cell counts of the
graph of a concrete triple evaluate by `decide` and `#eval`.
