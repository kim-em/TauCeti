# Enumeration of connected permutation triples

Connectedness of a permutation triple is decidable, so the connected triples of a given degree
form a computable finset, and so do their isomorphism classes, each class listed as the finset of
connected triples it contains — the relabeling orbit, not a chosen representative. This file
records both finsets and identifies their members and cardinalities with the corresponding types,
and then establishes the number of isomorphism classes of connected triples — equivalently, of
connected dessins d'enfants with a given number of edges — in degrees one to three:

```text
degree               1   2   3
connected classes    1   3   7
```

The three degree-two classes are the double cover of the sphere branched at two of the three
branch points, one class for each choice of the unbranched point. The seven degree-three classes
are the cyclic cover `z ↦ z³` in its three orderings of the branch points (monodromy `C₃`, one
branch point unramified), the `S₃`-cover `TauCeti.PermutationTriple.s3Triple` in its three
orderings (monodromy `S₃`), and the genus-one cover with a three-cycle at every branch point
(monodromy `C₃`). The twenty-six degree-four classes are counted by
`TauCeti.ConnectedIsoClass.card_four` in `TauCeti.Combinatorics.PermutationTriple.SmallDegrees`,
as a consequence of their classification by cycle data.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.connectedTriples n`: the connected permutation triples of degree `n`, as a finset.
* `TauCeti.isoClasses n`: their isomorphism classes, as the finset of relabeling orbits.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.mem_connectedTriples`, `TauCeti.mem_isoClasses`: the members of the two finsets are
  exactly the connected triples, and exactly the relabeling orbits of connected triples.
* `TauCeti.existsUnique_mem_isoClasses`: every connected triple lies in exactly one member of
  `TauCeti.isoClasses n`, so the listed orbits partition the connected triples.
* `TauCeti.card_connectedTriples`, `TauCeti.card_isoClasses`: the two finsets have the
  cardinalities of `TauCeti.ConnectedTriple n` and `TauCeti.ConnectedIsoClass n`.
* `TauCeti.ConnectedIsoClass.card_one`, `TauCeti.ConnectedIsoClass.card_two`,
  `TauCeti.ConnectedIsoClass.card_three`: the number of isomorphism classes of connected
  permutation triples of degree one, two, and three.
