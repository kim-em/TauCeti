# Triangulable topological spaces

A topological space is triangulable if it is homeomorphic to the geometric realization of an
abstract simplicial complex. This is deliberately weaker than carrying a combinatorial or PL
manifold structure: no link condition is imposed on the witnessing complex.

This file supplies the homeomorphism-invariance API and shows that realizations and discrete
topological spaces are triangulable.

This is the general triangulability notion fixed in layer 11 of the geometric-topology roadmap.

## Main definitions

* `IsTriangulable`: a space is homeomorphic to the realization of an abstract simplicial complex.

## Main results

* `Homeomorph.isTriangulable_iff`: triangulability is invariant under homeomorphism.
* `isTriangulable_of_discreteTopology`: every discrete space is triangulable.
