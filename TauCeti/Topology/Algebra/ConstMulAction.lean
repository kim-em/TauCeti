# Transfer instances for restricted and properly discontinuous actions

This file records generic instances for actions on a topological space that typeclass search
cannot otherwise reach. A submonoid, and hence a subgroup, inherits `ContinuousConstSMul` from
an ambient scalar action; and a properly discontinuous action has `Finite` point stabilisers.

## Main results

* `Submonoid.continuousConstSMul` and `TauCeti.Subgroup.continuousConstSMul`: continuity
  in the point is inherited by a submonoid, hence by a subgroup.
* `TauCeti.finite_stabilizer_of_properlyDiscontinuousSMul`: a properly discontinuous action has
  finite point stabilisers, as an instance rather than as `Set.Finite` of the carrier.

/-- **A properly discontinuous action has finite point stabilisers**, as a `Finite` instance.

Mathlib's `ProperlyDiscontinuousSMul.finite_stabilizer` (Alex Kontorovich and Heather Macbeth,
`Mathlib/Topology/Algebra/ConstMulAction.lean`) states this as `Set.Finite` of the stabiliser's
carrier. That form does not drive typeclass search, so a count through `Nat.card` — which is the
junk value `0` on an infinite type — has to bridge to `Finite` by hand at each use. This does it
once, for every properly discontinuous action.

For an action of a subgroup of `GL(2, ℝ)` no further instance is needed: Mathlib's
`Subgroup.IsArithmetic.properlyDiscontinuous` supplies proper discontinuity for an arithmetic
`𝒢 ≤ GL(2, ℝ)`, and the image of a finite-index `Γ ≤ SL(2, ℤ)` is arithmetic, so both shapes
reach `Finite` through this instance alone. The stabiliser of a point under `SL(2, ℤ)` itself is
*not* one of those shapes — `SL(2, ℤ)` is a type, not a `Subgroup (GL (Fin 2) ℝ)`, so there is no
`ProperlyDiscontinuousSMul SL(2, ℤ) ℍ` to apply — and stays with the hand-proved
`TauCeti.ModularGroup.finite_stabilizer`. -/
