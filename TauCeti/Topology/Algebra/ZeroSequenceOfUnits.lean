# Zero sequences of units

Henkel's open mapping theorem is stated for a topological ring carrying a *zero sequence of
units*: a sequence of units converging to zero. This file isolates that hypothesis and proves the
absorption property it exists for — every element is carried into every neighbourhood of zero by
some term of the sequence, so the dilates of a neighbourhood cover the space acted on.

The class carries no continuity, and this file assumes no continuity *instance* either, so each
result below takes an explicit `hc : ContinuousAt (fun a : A ↦ a • x) 0` — continuity of the
scalar action in the scalar alone, at zero, for the vector in question. Without it the statements
are false for a monoid with an arbitrary topology. `ContinuousSMul A M` would do but is
joint continuity, strictly more than these proofs use.

Nothing here is Huber-specific, or even ring-specific: `A` needs only `[Monoid A]`, `[Zero A]`,
and `[TopologicalSpace A]`. No compatibility between zero and multiplication is required.
The results act on a topological space `M` with `[Zero M]` and scalar multiplication by `A`.
No additive structure on `M` is required, so `M` is not assumed to be a module.

How much scalar multiplication is needed splits the file in two. The two pointwise absorption
results ask for `[SMul A M]` and `h0 : (0 : A) • x = 0` at the given vector. The covering
theorem requires `[MulAction A M]` and `h0 : ∀ x : M, (0 : A) • x = 0`.
Neither requires scalar multiplication to preserve zero in the vector argument.

That is the form Henkel's theorem needs, since his Baire argument covers the *domain* of the map
rather than the base ring; taking `M = A` recovers the ring statements. The bridge to Huber
theory — that the powers of a pseudouniformiser are such a sequence, so a Tate ring qualifies —
is in `TauCeti/RingTheory/Huber/ZeroSequenceOfUnits.lean`.

The covering is the point, and it must be **countable**. Henkel's proof applies a Baire argument
to the sets `uₙ⁻¹ • U` indexed by `n : ℕ`; a cover indexed by all of `Aˣ` would exhaust `M` just
as well but could not start that argument. Both results are therefore stated for an
arbitrary zero sequence, so that a caller holding a concrete one — the powers of a
pseudouniformiser, say — keeps it rather than trading it for an opaque choice.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.HasZeroSequenceOfUnits`: the monoid admits a sequence of units tending to zero.

## Main results

All three carry the continuity hypothesis described above; the covering needs it at every vector,
the two pointwise results only at their own.

* `TauCeti.exists_smul_mem_of_tendsto_zero`: along any zero sequence of units, some term carries a
  given element of a space with `[SMul A M]` and `0 • x = 0` into a neighbourhood of zero.
* `TauCeti.iUnion_inv_smul_eq_univ_of_tendsto_zero`: its dilates `uₙ⁻¹ • U` cover `M`, indexed
  by `ℕ`. This needs `[MulAction A M]` and `0 • x = 0` for every vector.
* `TauCeti.HasZeroSequenceOfUnits.exists_unit_smul_mem`: the weaker unit-only form of absorption —
  it produces some `v : Aˣ`, with no sequence and no term index. Being an absorption result it too
  needs only `[SMul A M]` and `0 • x = 0` at the given vector.

/-- There is a sequence of units converging to zero. For a ring, this is Henkel's hypothesis.

Only a monoid with a distinguished zero and a topology is needed to state the condition.

A discrete ring has none unless it is trivial, and that is the intended exclusion: the theorem
needs to shrink a neighbourhood by an invertible factor. -/

/-- The class unfolds to the existential it wraps. This is its `@[simp]` normal form; a proof
already holding the instance normally reaches the sequence through the field directly, as
`‹HasZeroSequenceOfUnits A›.exists_tendsto`. -/

/-- **Absorption.** Along a zero sequence of units in `A`, every element of a space `M` carrying a
scalar multiplication by `A` satisfying `0 • x = 0` is carried into every neighbourhood of zero
by some term of the sequence.

Stated for an arbitrary such sequence rather than a chosen one, so a caller holding a concrete
sequence — the powers of a pseudouniformiser, say — gets the conclusion for *that* sequence.

The hypothesis `hc` requires continuity of `a ↦ a • x` at `0 : A`, with `x` fixed. This is
weaker than the joint continuity required by `ContinuousSMul A M`. When `M = A`,
`(continuous_mul_const x).continuousAt` supplies this hypothesis modulo `smul_eq_mul`. -/

/-- **The countable covering Henkel's Baire argument runs on**: the dilates `uₙ⁻¹ • U` of a
neighbourhood of zero exhaust `M`. The index is `ℕ`, which is what makes the cover usable in a
Baire argument — a cover by all of `Aˣ` would exhaust `M` too but could not start that argument.
Henkel needs this for the *domain* of the map, which is why `M` is not just the base ring. -/

/-- Some unit of `A` carries a given element of `M` into a given neighbourhood of zero.

Deliberately not phrased with a sequence: quantifying over an unconstrained `u : ℕ → Aˣ` would
say no more than this, since a constant sequence witnesses it. The sequence matters only for
`iUnion_inv_smul_eq_univ_of_tendsto_zero`, which is stated for a given sequence carrying its own
convergence hypothesis rather than restated at class level. -/
