# Closed Spin carriers

For a nondegenerate quadratic form on a finite-dimensional space over a Hausdorff topological field
in which `2` is invertible, Mathlib's Spin group is closed in the Clifford algebra with its module
topology. In positive dimension the Spin group is the set of even unitary elements whose twisted
conjugation preserves the vectors, each of which is a closed condition: the unitary group is closed,
the even part and the space of vectors are finite-dimensional subspaces, and twisted conjugation is
continuous. On the zero space the Spin group is trivial. Over a locally compact field the Spin
group is therefore a locally compact Hausdorff topological group, the Spin point group over `ℝ` and
`ℚ_p`.

This module also proves that every nondegenerate Spin carrier is closed in the units of its
Clifford algebra, providing the closed-subgroup input for Lie-group structures. The corresponding
real special-orthogonal carrier is provided separately in `RealSpecialOrthogonal.lean`.
