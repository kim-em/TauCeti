# The spinor kernel is open

Let `Q` be a nondegenerate quadratic form on a finite-dimensional space over a locally compact
nontrivially normed field `K` in which `2` is invertible, such as `ℝ` or `ℚ_p`, and suppose that
the squares are open in `Kˣ`. Then the kernel of the spinor norm `θ : O(Q) → Kˣ ⧸ (Kˣ)²` is open
in the orthogonal group, and so are the kernel of its restriction to `SO(Q)` and the image of the
Spin group in `SO(Q)`, which is that kernel.

The spinor norm is the Clifford norm `N x = reverse x * x` of a Lipschitz lift read modulo squares.
So the kernel of `θ` is the image, under the vector representation, of the Lipschitz elements whose
Clifford norm is a square. That set is open because the Clifford norm is continuous and the squares
are open, and its image is open because the vector representation is an open map.

Equivalently, both spinor-norm homomorphisms are continuous when their square-class codomain has
the quotient topology. The openness of the squares cannot be dropped, and it does not follow from
the topology on `V`:
over `ℝ` the squares are the positive reals, while over `ℚ_p` it is the local-field fact that the
units deep enough in the unit filtration are squares. Discreteness of the square-class group alone
would only show that a *continuous* map into it is locally constant.

## Main results

* `CliffordAlgebra.isOpen_ker_orthogonalSpinorNorm`: the kernel of the spinor norm on `O(Q)` is
  open.
* `CliffordAlgebra.isOpen_ker_spinorNorm`: the kernel of the spinor norm on `SO(Q)` is open.
* `CliffordAlgebra.isOpen_range_spinToSpecialOrthogonal`: the image of the Spin group in `SO(Q)`
  is open.
* `CliffordAlgebra.continuous_orthogonalSpinorNorm`,
  `CliffordAlgebra.continuous_spinorNorm`: the spinor norms on `O(Q)` and `SO(Q)` are continuous.
