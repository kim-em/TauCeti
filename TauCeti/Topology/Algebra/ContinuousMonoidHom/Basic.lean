# Continuity of homomorphisms and maps involving subgroups and quotients

Mathlib's `Subgroup.subtype` and `QuotientGroup.mk'` are bare `MonoidHom`s, and its coercion
`ContinuousMonoidHom.toContinuousMonoidHom` applies only to bundled types that already carry a
`ContinuousMapClass` instance, so neither map is available as a `ContinuousMonoidHom`. This file
packages those maps for a topological group and the subspace and quotient topologies. It also
provides inverse conjugation `n ↦ g⁻¹ * n * g` on a normal subgroup, together with its evaluation,
identity, and composition laws, and the continuous lift through a quotient by a normal subgroup.
Named compatibility proofs describe subgroup inclusions and composition of scalar/coefficient maps
for pullbacks of cochains; composition uses Mathlib's semiconjugacy API.
A homomorphism from a topological group with open kernel is also continuous, for every topology
on the target. The projections of a product of topological monoids onto its factors are
packaged as `ContinuousMonoidHom.proj`, next to Mathlib's `ContinuousMonoidHom.fst` and
`ContinuousMonoidHom.snd`. Integer powers of continuous homomorphisms into a commutative
topological group are computed pointwise, and the multiplicative isomorphism underlying a
continuous multiplicative isomorphism has the same underlying function. A topologically embedded
continuous group homomorphism is also packaged as a continuous multiplicative equivalence with its
range, with forward and inverse computation rules. The file also records the
pointwise characterization of finite-order continuous homomorphisms and the open kernel of a
finite-order continuous character into complex units.
Kernels of continuous homomorphisms into a `T1` monoid are closed, so on a compact group the
common kernel of a family of them is approximated from outside by the common kernels of its
finite subfamilies, and the range of a continuous homomorphism out of a compact group into a
Hausdorff group is a closed subgroup.
