# Closures, closed images, and pointwise quotients

Mathlib relates `closure` to a pointwise product when one factor is *open* — `IsOpen.mul_closure`
and its neighbours in `Mathlib/Topology/Algebra/Group/Pointwise.lean` — and to a pointwise scalar
product when the action is jointly continuous, in `smul_set_closure_subset`. The containment for
division, which needs neither openness nor a group structure, is not there.

It is what a Baire argument needs. Such an argument produces a set whose *closure* has interior,
and the step from there to a neighbourhood of the identity runs through `D / D` for that closure
`D`; without this containment there is no way back from `closure s / closure t` to a closure.

Multiplication and addition carry a closed relation to a closed set if its second coordinate
lies in a compact set. This applies to bounded displacements in proper normed spaces, even when
the first coordinate ranges over a noncompact set.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.closure_div_closure_subset`, with its additive form
  `TauCeti.closure_sub_closure_subset`.
* `IsClosed.image_mul_of_snd_subset`, with its additive form
  `IsClosed.image_add_of_snd_subset`.
