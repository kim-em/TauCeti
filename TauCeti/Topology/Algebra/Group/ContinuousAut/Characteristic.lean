# Topologically characteristic subgroups

A subgroup of a topological group is **topologically characteristic** if every continuous
automorphism preserves it. This is weaker than Mathlib's `Subgroup.Characteristic`, which tests
all abstract automorphisms. The distinction matters for profinite groups, whose abstract
automorphisms need not be continuous.

The predicate `TauCeti.IsTopCharacteristic G N` is expressed by the image equation
`N.map φ = N`. Its equivalent image and preimage inclusion criteria make it convenient to prove,
and it is stable under arbitrary suprema and infima. A topologically characteristic subgroup is
normal as soon as inner automorphisms are continuous, and so is a topologically characteristic
subgroup of a normal subgroup.

In a topologically finitely generated compact group the topologically characteristic open normal
subgroups are cofinal among the open subgroups: an open subgroup has finite index, there are
finitely many open subgroups of that index, and their intersection is preserved by every
continuous automorphism. When the group is moreover totally disconnected, these subgroups form a
neighbourhood basis of the identity. This is what makes the congruence topology on
`ContinuousAut G` behave well for a topologically finitely generated profinite group `G`.

The characterizations and lattice API parallel Mathlib's API for
`Subgroup.Characteristic` in `Mathlib.Algebra.Group.Subgroup.Basic`.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.IsTopCharacteristic`: invariance of a subgroup under every continuous automorphism.

## Main results

* `Subgroup.Characteristic.isTopCharacteristic`: every abstractly characteristic subgroup is
  topologically characteristic.
* `TauCeti.IsTopCharacteristic.normal`: a topologically characteristic subgroup is normal when
  inner automorphisms are continuous.
* `TauCeti.IsTopCharacteristic.map_subtype_normal`: a topologically characteristic subgroup of a
  normal subgroup is normal in the ambient group.
* `TauCeti.IsTopologicallyFinitelyGenerated.exists_isTopCharacteristic_le`: in a topologically
  finitely generated compact group, every open subgroup contains a topologically characteristic
  open normal subgroup.
* `TauCeti.IsTopologicallyFinitelyGenerated.exists_isTopCharacteristic_subset`: in a topologically
  finitely generated profinite group, every neighbourhood of the identity contains a topologically
  characteristic open normal subgroup.
