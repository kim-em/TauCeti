# Automorphisms of characteristic quotients

A continuous automorphism of a group with a topology induces an abstract automorphism of each
quotient by a topologically characteristic normal subgroup. These quotient automorphisms are
the coordinates used in the congruence topology on `ContinuousAut G`. Two automorphisms share a
coordinate exactly when they agree modulo the subgroup at every point, and the formula on quotient
classes also shows that inner automorphisms descend to inner automorphisms.

See Ribes–Zalesskii, *Profinite Groups*, §4.4.
