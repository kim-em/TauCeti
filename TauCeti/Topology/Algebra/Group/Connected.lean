# Connectedness of topological groups

This file derives connectedness of a group from preconnectedness of a subgroup and its coset
quotient, and develops the identity component `Subgroup.connectedComponentOfOne G` of a
topological group `G`: it is a closed normal subgroup, it lies in every open subgroup, continuous
homomorphisms preserve it, and the quotient of `G` by it is totally disconnected.  Thus a group
whose quotient by its identity component is compact is an extension of a profinite group by a
connected one.

## Main results

* `Subgroup.connectedSpace_of_quotient`: a group with continuous left translations is
  connected when a subgroup and the corresponding coset quotient are preconnected.
* `Subgroup.connectedComponentOfOne_le_of_isOpen`: an open subgroup contains the identity
  component.
* `Subgroup.map_connectedComponentOfOne_le`: a continuous homomorphism maps the identity
  component into the identity component.
* `QuotientGroup.totallyDisconnectedSpace_connectedComponentOfOne`: the quotient of a
  topological group by its identity component is totally disconnected.
