# Quotients of topological groups by subgroups

Generic facts about quotients by subgroups of topological groups. Most results use
`[IsTopologicalGroup G]`; forward translation of a fixed coset needs only
`[SeparatelyContinuousMul G]`. The inverse-translation results additionally require
`[DiscreteTopology (G ⧸ U)]`. Neither compactness nor total disconnectedness is needed.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.quotientOpenSubgroup`: the image of an open subgroup of `G` in `G ⧸ N`, as an open
  subgroup.
* `TauCeti.quotientOpenSubgroupMap`: the quotient homomorphism restricted to an open subgroup.
* `TauCeti.quotientSubgroupOfEquivMap`: for an open normal subgroup `V`, the quotient
  `W ⧸ V.subgroupOf W` is isomorphic, as a topological group, to the image of `W` in `G ⧸ V`.
* `TauCeti.quotientQuotientContinuousMulEquiv`: for an open normal subgroup `V` contained in a
  normal subgroup `W`, the third isomorphism theorem `(G ⧸ V) ⧸ W.map (mk' V) ≃ₜ* G ⧸ W`.

## Main results

* `Subgroup.continuous_smul_const`: translation of a fixed coset is continuous.
* `Subgroup.continuous_inv_smul_const`: inverse translation of a fixed coset is
  continuous when the quotient is discrete.
* `Subgroup.continuous_inv_smul`: inverse translation is jointly continuous when
  the quotient is discrete.
* `QuotientGroup.instDiscreteTopology`: the quotient of a discrete group by any subgroup is
  discrete.
* `QuotientGroup.continuous_mapOfLE`: the quotient homomorphism `G ⧸ V →* G ⧸ U` for normal
  subgroups `V ≤ U` is continuous.
* `QuotientGroup.isClopen_image_mk`: the image of an open subgroup of `G` under the
  quotient map `G → G ⧸ N` is clopen.
* `QuotientGroup.comapMk'OpenNormalOrderIso`: open normal subgroups of `G ⧸ N` correspond,
  as lattices, to the open normal subgroups of `G` containing `N`.
* `TauCeti.quotientOpenSubgroup_index`: quotienting by a subgroup of `U` preserves the index
  of `U`.
