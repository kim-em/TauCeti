# Finite-quotient determinacy of profinite groups

A topologically finitely generated profinite group is determined by its continuous finite
quotients (`TauCeti.IsFiniteContinuousQuotient`, defined in
`TauCeti.Topology.Algebra.Group.FiniteQuotients`): if `G` is topologically finitely generated and
the profinite groups `G` and `H` have the same continuous finite quotients, then `G ≃ₜ* H`. Finite
generation is assumed on one side only, and is a conclusion on the other.

The theorem is assembled from three implications between finite-quotient data and maps.

* **Finite generation descends.** If `G` is topologically finitely generated and every continuous
  finite quotient of the profinite group `H` is one of `G`, then `H` is topologically finitely
  generated (`IsTopologicallyFinitelyGenerated.of_forall_isFiniteContinuousQuotient`).
* **Finite-quotient data produces a surjection.** If `H` is a topologically finitely generated
  compact group and every quotient `G ⧸ N` of the profinite group `G` by an open normal subgroup
  occurs as a continuous quotient of `H`, then there is a continuous surjection `H ↠ G`
  (`exists_continuous_surjective_of_forall_isFiniteContinuousQuotient`).
* **Surjections in both directions are isomorphisms.** If `G` is topologically finitely generated
  and profinite, continuous surjections `G ↠ H` and `H ↠ G` make `G ↠ H` bijective
  (`IsTopologicallyFinitelyGenerated.bijective_of_surjective_of_surjective`, the Hopf property of
  `G`), hence a topological isomorphism when `H` is also compact Hausdorff.

Finite generation cannot be dropped on both sides: for a prime `p`, the products `∏_{i : ℕ} ℤ/p`
and `∏_{i : ℝ} ℤ/p` have the same continuous finite quotients, namely the finite elementary abelian
`p`-groups, but they have different cardinalities.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.IsTopologicallyFinitelyGenerated.of_forall_isFiniteContinuousQuotient`: a profinite
  group whose continuous finite quotients all occur for a topologically finitely generated one is
  topologically finitely generated.
* `TauCeti.exists_continuous_surjective_of_forall_isFiniteContinuousQuotient`: a topologically
  finitely generated compact group surjects continuously onto a profinite group all of whose
  finite quotients it has.
* `TauCeti.exists_surjective_and_exists_surjective_of_forall_isFiniteContinuousQuotient_iff`:
  two profinite groups with the same continuous finite quotients, one of them topologically
  finitely generated, admit continuous surjections in both directions.
* `TauCeti.nonempty_continuousMulEquiv_of_forall_isFiniteContinuousQuotient_iff`: **finite-quotient
  determinacy**: such groups are topologically isomorphic.
