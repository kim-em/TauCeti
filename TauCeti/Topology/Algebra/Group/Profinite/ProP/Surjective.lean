# Surjectivity detected by the Frattini quotient

A homomorphism into a profinite pro-`p` group has dense range exactly when its composites
with all index-`p` quotient maps are surjective. Equivalently, its composite with the
Frattini quotient map has dense range. For continuous homomorphisms from compact groups,
the images are closed, so these criteria detect surjectivity itself.

These are the homomorphism forms of Burnside's basis theorem: they check surjectivity of a
map given on generators by checking its values modulo the Frattini subgroup. The source
need not be pro-`p`, and the density criteria need no topology on the source.

The same reduction shows that a topological generating family stays one when each member is
replaced by a conjugate of a `p`-adic power of it by a unit
(`IsProP.topologicalClosure_closure_range_eq_top_of_isConj_padicPow`): modulo the Frattini
subgroup conjugation is trivial, and a unit power generates the same closed subgroup as its base.
This is what makes a continuous endomorphism of a free pro-`p` group of finite rank that sends each
generator to a conjugate of a unit power of itself an automorphism.
