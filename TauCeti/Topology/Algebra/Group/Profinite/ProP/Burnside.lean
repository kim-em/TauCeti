# Burnside generation for pro-`p` groups

For a pro-`p` group, the Frattini subgroup detects topological generation. A closed subgroup
which is not contained in any open normal subgroup of index `p` is the whole group, and hence a
set topologically generates the group exactly when its image topologically generates the
Frattini quotient.

The finite input is that a maximal subgroup of a finite `p`-group has index `p`. To apply it to a
proper closed subgroup `H` of a profinite pro-`p` group, first choose an open normal subgroup `U`
for which `H ⊔ U` is still proper. The image of `H` in the finite `p`-group `G/U` lies in a
maximal subgroup. Its pullback is an open normal subgroup of index `p` containing `H`.

As a consequence, a **Frattini cover** `φ : G → H` of a pro-`p` group `G`, that is a continuous
homomorphism whose kernel lies in the Frattini subgroup, is a topological isomorphism as soon as it
has a continuous homomorphic section `s`: the range of `s` is closed and generates `G` together
with the Frattini subgroup, so `s` is surjective and is a two-sided inverse of `φ`.

The Frattini argument also runs relative to a pro-`p` subgroup of a profinite group which is not
itself pro-`p`. If `P` is a closed pro-`p` subgroup of `G`, a normal subgroup of `G` contained in
`Φ(P)` consists of non-generators of `G`. In particular, for a normal pro-`p` subgroup `P`, a set
generating `G` modulo `⁅P, P⁆` already generates `G`. This is how the wild inertia subgroup of the
absolute Galois group of a `p`-adic field is removed when counting generators.

## Main results

* `IsProP.eq_top_of_forall_not_le_openNormalSubgroup_index_eq`: the index-`p` detection
  criterion for closed subgroups.
* `IsProP.eq_top_of_sup_proPFrattini_eq_top`: the Frattini subgroup consists of
  non-generators.
* `IsProP.surjective_of_forall_inv_mul_mem_proPFrattini`: a continuous endomorphism congruent to
  the identity modulo the Frattini subgroup is surjective.
* `IsProP.surjective_of_surjective_comp_of_ker_le_proPFrattini`: a homomorphism with closed range
  whose composite with a Frattini cover is surjective is surjective.
* `IsProP.continuousMulEquivOfLeftInverse`: a Frattini cover with a continuous homomorphic
  section is a topological isomorphism, with the section as inverse.
* `topologicallyGenerates_iff_frattiniQuotient`: a set generates topologically if and only if
  its image generates the Frattini quotient topologically.
* `IsProP.eq_top_of_le_map_proPFrattini_of_sup_eq_top`: the relative Frattini argument, a
  normal subgroup of `G` inside the Frattini subgroup of a closed pro-`p` subgroup consists of
  non-generators of `G`.
* `IsProP.topologicalClosure_eq_top_of_sup_commutator`: a set generating `G` topologically
  together with `⁅P, P⁆`, for a normal pro-`p` subgroup `P`, generates `G` topologically.

/-! ### The relative Frattini argument

A closed pro-`p` subgroup `P` of a profinite group `G` has its own Frattini subgroup `Φ(P)`. When
a normal subgroup `N` of `G` lies in `Φ(P)`, its elements are non-generators of `G` itself, even
though `G` need not be pro-`p`: if `H ⊔ N = G`, the modular law gives `P = (H ⊓ P) ⊔ N`, so
`H ⊓ P` and `Φ(P)` generate `P`, whence `P ≤ H` and `H = G`. The closure of the commutator
subgroup `⁅P, P⁆` of a closed normal pro-`p` subgroup is such an `N`. -/

/-- **The relative Frattini argument.** Let `P` be a closed pro-`p` subgroup of a profinite group
`G`, and `N` a normal subgroup of `G` contained in the pro-`p` Frattini subgroup `Φ(P)` of `P`. A
closed subgroup `H` of `G` with `H ⊔ N = G` is all of `G`. -/
