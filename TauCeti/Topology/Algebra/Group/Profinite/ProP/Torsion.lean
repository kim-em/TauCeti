# The torsion subgroup of a topologically finitely generated abelian pro-`p` group

The structure theorem identifies a topologically finitely generated abelian pro-`p` group `A`
with `ℤ_p ^ r × T` for a finite abelian `p`-group `T`. This file describes the two factors of
that decomposition and proves uniqueness of the rank and elementary divisors.

* The finite factor `T` is the torsion subgroup of `A`. Consequently the torsion subgroup is
  finite and closed, and it is open exactly when `A` is finite.
* The quotient `A ⧸ torsion A` is topologically isomorphic to `ℤ_p ^ r`; in particular a
  torsion-free topologically finitely generated abelian pro-`p` group is `ℤ_p ^ r`.
* The rank is unique: in any two decompositions `A ≅ ℤ_p ^ r × T ≅ ℤ_p ^ r' × T'` with `T` and
  `T'` torsion, `r = r'`, because both `ℤ_p ^ r` and `ℤ_p ^ r'` are the quotient by the torsion
  subgroup and a continuous additive isomorphism `ℤ_p ^ r ≃ ℤ_p ^ r'` is `ℤ_p`-linear. The
  uniqueness of the torsion factor, `T ≅ T'`, needs no pro-`p` hypothesis and is
  `TauCeti.torsionFactorAddEquiv` in `TauCeti.GroupTheory.Torsion`.
* When the finite factors are products of `ZMod (p ^ e i)` with positive exponents, that
  torsion-factor equivalence determines the exponents up to a bijection of the index types.
* For the canonical `ℤ_[p]`-module `TauCeti.IsProP.module`, the torsion submodule is the torsion
  subgroup, and the decomposition holds as topological `ℤ_[p]`-modules: the module is continuously
  linearly isomorphic to `ℤ_p ^ r` times its torsion submodule. This is the form of the structure
  theorem in which `T` is literally the torsion subgroup and the splitting respects the
  `ℤ_[p]`-action and the topology.

Finiteness of the torsion subgroup is what makes the torsion subgroup of the abelianisation of a
topologically finitely generated pro-`p` group a finite invariant; the `q`-invariant of a Demushkin
group is read off from it.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.IsProP.finite_torsion`, `TauCeti.IsProP.isClosed_torsion`,
  `TauCeti.IsProP.isOpen_torsion_iff_finite`: the torsion subgroup is finite, closed, and open
  exactly when the group is finite.
* `TauCeti.IsProP.exists_continuousMulEquiv_pi_padicInt`: a torsion-free topologically finitely
  generated abelian pro-`p` group is topologically isomorphic to `ℤ_p ^ r`.
* `TauCeti.IsProP.exists_continuousMulEquiv_quotient_torsion_pi_padicInt`: the quotient by the
  torsion subgroup is topologically isomorphic to `ℤ_p ^ r`.
* `TauCeti.eq_of_continuousMulEquiv_pi_padicInt_prod`: uniqueness of the rank `r`.
* `TauCeti.exists_equiv_exponents_of_continuousMulEquiv_pi_padicInt_prod_pi_zmod`:
  uniqueness of the positive elementary-divisor exponents up to reindexing.
* `TauCeti.IsProP.mem_torsion_module_iff`, `TauCeti.IsProP.finite_torsion_module`: the torsion
  submodule of the canonical `ℤ_[p]`-module is the torsion subgroup, and is finite.
* `TauCeti.IsProP.isTorsionFree_module_iff`: the canonical `ℤ_[p]`-module is torsion-free
  exactly when the group is.
* `TauCeti.IsProP.exists_continuousLinearEquiv_pi_padicInt_prod_torsion`: the structure theorem as
  a continuous `ℤ_[p]`-linear equivalence `A ≃ ℤ_p ^ r × T`, with `T` the torsion submodule.
