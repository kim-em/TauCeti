# The universal property of profinite completion

This file restates the categorical universal property of Mathlib's profinite completion for
unbundled groups and continuous monoid homomorphisms. It also proves that the canonical map from
a finite group to its profinite completion is bijective, and exposes the projections of the
profinite completion onto the finite quotients it is the limit of.

The correspondence `continuousMonoidHomEquiv` allows the group and the profinite target to live
in independent universes, unlike Mathlib's single-universe adjunction
`ProfiniteGrp.ProfiniteCompletion.homEquiv`; this is what lets a fixed universe-polymorphic
completion, such as the profinite integers, map to profinite groups in any universe.

A continuous homomorphism out of the completion is surjective onto a Hausdorff target when it has
dense range on `G` (`surjective_continuousMonoidHom_of_denseRange`), and injective when every
finite-index normal subgroup of `G` contains the elements sent near `1`
(`injective_continuousMonoidHom_of_forall_exists_nhds_one_comap_le`).

The continuous finite quotients of the completion are exactly the finite quotients of `G`
(`isFiniteContinuousQuotient_iff_exists_surjective`), and the completion of a finitely generated
group is topologically finitely generated (`isTopologicallyFinitelyGenerated`). Through the
finite-quotient determinacy of topologically finitely generated profinite groups this gives the
theorem of Dixon, Formanek, Poland and Ribes: two finitely generated groups with the same finite
quotients have topologically isomorphic profinite completions
(`nonempty_continuousMulEquiv_of_forall_exists_surjective_iff`); in fact finite generation of one
of the two groups suffices.
