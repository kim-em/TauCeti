# Continuous sections of profinite quotients

Let `G` be a profinite group — compact, totally disconnected, and topological, in the unbundled
classes — and let `H` be a *closed* subgroup. This module proves that the quotient map
`G → G ⧸ H` admits a continuous section normalized at the identity coset, and deduces the same
for the projection `G ⧸ K → G ⧸ H` attached to a pair of subgroups `K ≤ H`.

The proof produces a closed left transversal: a closed set meeting every left coset of `H` exactly
once. Zorn's lemma, applied to the pairs `(K, C)` where `C` is a closed set meeting every left
coset of `H` in exactly one coset of the subgroup `K ≤ H`, yields a minimal such pair; the
refinement step shows a minimal pair has `K = ⊥`, which is exactly the transversal condition. That
step is where the topology enters: an element `h ≠ 1` of
`K` is separated from `1` by an open normal subgroup `N`, and the `N`-cosets inside a `K`-coset
`xK` biject with the cosets of the image of `K` in the finite group `G ⧸ N`, so choosing one
representative per coset there thins `C` down along a *clopen* condition, which preserves
closedness. Passing to a chain also uses compactness: Cantor's intersection theorem shows that the
intersection of a chain of such `C`'s still meets every coset.

## Main results

* `Subgroup.exists_isClosed_isComplement_left`: a closed subgroup of a profinite group has
  a closed left transversal, in Mathlib's sense `Subgroup.IsComplement`.
* `TauCeti.exists_continuous_section`: the normalized continuous section `G ⧸ H → G`.
* `TauCeti.exists_continuous_section_of_le`: the continuous section of `G ⧸ K → G ⧸ H` for `K ≤ H`.
* `TauCeti.exists_continuous_rightCosetFactorization`: the right-coset form, `g = w g * r g` with
  `w g ∈ H` and `r g` depending only on the right coset `H * g`, both continuous, and normalized
  by `w 1 = 1`.

## Implementation notes

The nearby false statement is that `G ⧸ H` is a projective object, so that *every* continuous
surjection onto it splits: profinite spaces are projective only when they are extremally
disconnected, and the section below genuinely uses the group structure of the fibres. None of this
is needed when `H` is *open*: then `G ⧸ H` is discrete and `Quotient.out` is already continuous,
which is how `Subgroup.exists_continuous_rightCosetFactorization_of_isOpen` is proved in the
general quotient section module.

/-- `IsCosetSelection H K C` says that the closed set `C` meets every left coset of `H` in exactly
one left coset of the subgroup `K ≤ H`. For `K = H` the set `C = Set.univ` qualifies, and for
`K = ⊥` the condition says exactly that `C` is a left transversal of `H`; the proof of
`Subgroup.exists_isClosed_isComplement_left` walks from the first to the second. -/

/-- **The refinement step.** A selection whose level `K` is nontrivial is not minimal: separating
`h ∈ K`, `h ≠ 1` from the identity by an open normal subgroup `N` and keeping, inside each coset
of `K`, the elements lying in one chosen coset of `N` produces a selection at the strictly smaller
level `K ⊓ N`. The chosen coset is picked in the group `G ⧸ N`, so the extra condition cutting `C`
down is the preimage of a set in a discrete space, and closedness survives. -/

group `G`, every `g : G` factors as `g = w g * r g` with `w g ∈ H`, where `r g` is a representative
of the *right* coset `H * g` depending only on that coset and `w` is the resulting `H`-valued
cocycle; both are continuous.  The factorization is normalized: `w 1 = 1`, inherited from the
normalization of `TauCeti.exists_continuous_section`.

Mathlib's quotient `G ⧸ H` is the space of *left* cosets, so `TauCeti.exists_continuous_section`
produces a continuous choice of representatives of `g H`. Inverting exchanges the two sides:
`r g = (s ⟦g⁻¹⟧)⁻¹` lies in `H * g` and depends only on `H * g`. This is the shape the coinduced
module of Layer 7 consumes, since its defining equivariance `f (h * g) = h • f g` is along right
cosets. -/
