# Tate's duality maps of a Demushkin group

For a finite discrete `𝔽_p[G]`-module `M` of a pro-`p` group `G`, Tate's duality maps
`αᵢ : Hⁱ(G, M) → Hom(H²⁻ⁱ(G, M'), H²(G, 𝔽_p))`, with `M' = Hom(M, 𝔽_p)`, are the cup products
with the evaluation pairing (`TauCeti.ContCohomology.dualityMap0`, `dualityMap1`, `dualityMap2`).
For an infinite Demushkin group they are isomorphisms for every such `M`: this is the perfect
duality on its finite modules, and the source of `cd_p G = 2`. This file proves it, following
Tate's argument in Serre's exposé, §9.1.

The base case is the trivial module `M = 𝔽_p`. Under evaluation at `1` the dual module
`Hom(𝔽_p, 𝔽_p)` is `𝔽_p` again, and the three maps read as follows. `α₁` is the cup square
`H¹(G, 𝔽_p) → Hom(H¹(G, 𝔽_p), H²(G, 𝔽_p))`, bijective because the cup square of a Demushkin group
is a perfect pairing (`TauCeti.IsDemushkin.cupFp_bijective`). `α₀` sends `c ∈ 𝔽_p = H⁰(G, 𝔽_p)` to
multiplication by `c` on `H²(G, 𝔽_p)`, bijective because `H²(G, 𝔽_p)` is one-dimensional. `α₂`
sends a class `b ∈ H²(G, 𝔽_p)` to `c ↦ c • b`, which is bijective for every group acting trivially
(`TauCeti.ContCohomology.dualityMap2_zmod_bijective`), so no statement about it is specific to
Demushkin groups.

The dévissage is the general one for pro-`p` groups
(`TauCeti.IsProP.dualityMap0_surjective_dualityMap1_injective` and
`TauCeti.IsProP.dualityMap1_surjective_dualityMap2_injective`, with `N = 𝔽_p` and `n = p`): every
finite `𝔽_p[G]`-module of a pro-`p` group is an iterated extension
of trivial modules of order `p`, and the four lemmas along a short exact sequence carry
surjectivity of `α₀`, bijectivity of `α₁` and injectivity of `α₂` from the two ends of an
extension to its middle; the Baer hypothesis on `H²(G, 𝔽_p)` holds because it is an
`𝔽_p`-vector space. Two further arguments, both needing `G` infinite, complete the duality.
Injectivity of `α₀` on `M` is the general `TauCeti.IsProP.dualityMap0_injective`: it follows from
injectivity of `α₁` on the kernel of a trace `Coind_V^G M → M` that vanishes on invariants, which
exists because `H⁰` is co-effaceable on an infinite pro-`p` group. Surjectivity of `α₂` on `M` is
then the general count `TauCeti.ContCohomology.dualityMap2_bijective_of_injective_of_addEquiv_zmod`:
`H²(G, 𝔽_p)` is `𝔽_p`, and injectivity of `α₂` on `M` and of `α₀` on `M'` together with the double
duality `M ≅ M''` give `|H²(G, M)| = |H⁰(G, M')|`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.IsDemushkin.dualityMap1_zmod_bijective`,
  `TauCeti.IsDemushkin.dualityMap0_zmod_bijective`: Tate's duality maps `α₁` and `α₀` at `M = 𝔽_p`
  are bijective.
* `TauCeti.IsDemushkin.dualityMap0_surjective`, `TauCeti.IsDemushkin.dualityMap1_bijective`,
  `TauCeti.IsDemushkin.dualityMap2_injective`: the dévissage, on every finite `𝔽_p[G]`-module `M`,
  `α₀` is surjective, `α₁` is bijective and `α₂` is injective.
* `TauCeti.IsDemushkin.dualityMap0_bijective`, `TauCeti.IsDemushkin.dualityMap2_bijective`: for an
  infinite Demushkin group all three duality maps are bijective on every finite `𝔽_p[G]`-module,
  **Tate's perfect duality**.
