# Topologically finitely generated profinite groups are Hopfian

A group is *Hopfian* when every surjective endomorphism of it is injective. A profinite group
that is topologically finitely generated is Hopfian in the continuous sense: a continuous
surjective `f : G →* G` is automatically a topological automorphism.

The proof is a counting argument on the open subgroups. Pulling back along a continuous
surjection preserves the index of a subgroup and is injective, so it restricts to an injective
self-map of the open subgroups of any fixed index; finite generation makes each of those sets
finite (`TauCeti.IsTopologicallyFinitelyGenerated.finite_openSubgroup_index_eq`), so the
restriction is a bijection and every open subgroup of `G` is a preimage `f ⁻¹' V`. Any such
preimage contains `ker f`, and in a profinite group the open subgroups intersect in the trivial
subgroup, so `ker f` is trivial. A continuous bijection of compact Hausdorff groups is a
topological isomorphism, which upgrades injectivity to
`TauCeti.IsTopologicallyFinitelyGenerated.continuousMulEquivOfSurjective`.

## Sharpness

Finite generation cannot be dropped: on `G = ∏_{i : ℕ} F` with `F` a nontrivial finite group
the shift `(x₀, x₁, …) ↦ (x₁, x₂, …)` is a continuous surjective endomorphism with nontrivial
kernel.

There is no co-Hopfian counterpart: the converse implication, that a continuous *injective*
endomorphism is surjective, is false even for `G = ℤ_p`, where multiplication by `p` is injective
and not surjective.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.IsTopologicallyFinitelyGenerated.ker_eq_bot_of_surjective`: a continuous surjective
  endomorphism of a topologically finitely generated profinite group has trivial kernel.
* `TauCeti.IsTopologicallyFinitelyGenerated.injective_of_surjective`: such an endomorphism is
  injective (the Hopf property).
* `TauCeti.IsTopologicallyFinitelyGenerated.bijective_of_surjective`: such an endomorphism is
  bijective.
* `TauCeti.IsTopologicallyFinitelyGenerated.bijective_of_surjective_of_surjective`: a continuous
  surjection out of such a group that admits a continuous surjection back is bijective.
* `TauCeti.IsTopologicallyFinitelyGenerated.continuousMulEquivOfSurjective`: it is a
  topological automorphism.
