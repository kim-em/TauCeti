# Finite covering spaces

A covering space is *finite* when all of its fibres are finite. This file records that condition
as a property of an object of `TopCat / X` and names the resulting full subcategory
`TauCeti.FiniteCoveringSpace X`, as an instance of `TauCeti.CoveringSpace.FullSubcategory`.

That general type carries the shared API, which is used here rather than restated; its docstring
says how to name its members from a subcategory. What this file
adds is the finiteness property, the constructor family and the inclusion functor — which are
given again because they pin `P` down to finiteness — and
`TauCeti.FiniteCoveringSpace.finite_fiber`, recording finiteness of every fibre as an instance.

Finiteness of all fibres is one condition rather than infinitely many as soon as the base is path
connected: monodromy along a path is a bijection between the fibres over its endpoints, so the
fibres over any two points of a path component are in bijection. That is
`TauCeti.coveringFiberEquiv`, from `TauCeti.Topology.Homotopy.Monodromy.Basic`, and
`TauCeti.hasFiniteFibers_of_finite_fiber` is the resulting one-point criterion.

Finite covers are the covering-space side of the Galois-category picture: the fibre over a
basepoint is a finite set with an action of `π₁`, and it is only for finite covers that the fibre
functor lands in `FintypeCat`.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.Over.hasFiniteFibers` and `TauCeti.Over.hasFiniteFibers_iff`: the property of an
  object of `TopCat / X` that all fibres of its structure morphism are finite, and its
  membership lemma.
* `TauCeti.FiniteCoveringSpace`: finite covering spaces over `X`.
* `TauCeti.FiniteCoveringSpace.mk`, `mk_coe`, `mk_proj`, `forget_obj_mk` and `forget`: the
  constructor, its computation lemmas and the inclusion into all covering spaces. The rest of the
  API is `TauCeti.CoveringSpace.FullSubcategory`'s.
* `TauCeti.FiniteCoveringSpace.finite_fiber`: every fibre of a finite covering space is finite.
* `TauCeti.hasFiniteFibers_of_finite_fiber`: over a path-connected base, one finite fibre makes
  all fibres finite.
