# Intermediate quotients of a quotient covering map

Let a group `G` act on a space `E` so that `q : E → X` presents `X` as the quotient `E / G` in
the strong sense of Mathlib's `IsQuotientCoveringMap`: the fibres of `q` are the orbits, and every
point of `E` has a neighbourhood whose `G`-translates are pairwise disjoint. Let `H` be a subgroup
of `G`, and let `qH : E → Y` present `Y` as `E / H` in the same sense. The projection `q` then
factors through `qH`, and the theorem of this file is that the factor

`r : E / H → E / G`

is a covering map. Neither space is assumed connected, and no local connectedness of `X` is
needed: the sheets of `r` over the base set `q '' U` are the images in `Y` of the translates
`g • U`, whose overlaps the disjointness hypothesis controls directly.

The intended reading is that a subgroup of the deck group of a regular covering cuts out an
intermediate covering. That is the shape of the subgroup-to-cover half of the classification of
covering spaces, where `E` is the universal cover of `X` and `G` is its fundamental group; that
application is `TauCeti.UniversalCover.isCoveringMap_subgroupQuotientProj`.

The file also records that a surjective covering map is an open quotient map: the companion,
for a covering map with no group acting, of Mathlib's `IsQuotientCoveringMap.isOpenQuotientMap`
that the rest of the file consumes. Finally, the quotient covering map of a finite group has
finite fibres, which is what makes it a finite covering with a transfer on singular chains.

## Main results

* `IsCoveringMap.isOpenQuotientMap`: a surjective covering map is an open quotient map.
* `IsQuotientCoveringMap.isCoveringMap_of_comp`: the map from the quotient by a subgroup down to
  the quotient by the whole group is a covering map.
* `IsQuotientCoveringMap.finite_fiber`: the quotient covering map of a finite group has finite
  fibres.

## Implementation notes

The sheets are produced by hand rather than by exhibiting `r` as a quotient covering map for some
group, because in general it is not one. The fibre of `r` over `q e` consists of the classes of
the points `g • e` for `g : G`, two of which agree exactly when `g` differs by an element of `H`;
the normalizer quotient `N_G(H) / H` acts on `E / H` over `X` by deck transformations of `r`, but
on that fibre it acts transitively only when `H` is normal in `G`. (Whether it exhausts the deck
transformations of `r` is a further question, needing connectedness hypotheses that are not
assumed here.)

So the construction goes through Mathlib's `IsOpen.trivializationDiscrete`, which turns a family
of pairwise disjoint sets on which the map is injective into a `Bundle.Trivialization`. The index
type of that family is the set of translate images itself, which makes the family injective and
its pairwise disjointness exactly the statement that two meeting translate images coincide.
