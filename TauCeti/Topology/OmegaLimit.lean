# The ω-limit set of a curve

The **ω-limit set** of a curve `u : ℝ → X` is the set of points that `u t` approaches as
`t → ∞`: the set of cluster points of `u` along `atTop`, written `{x | MapClusterPt x atTop u}`.
This file proves that it is the nested intersection `⋂ T, closure (u '' Ici T)` of the closures of
its tails and that it is preconnected. Its nonemptiness for a curve confined to a compact set is
the existing `IsCompact.exists_mapClusterPt`.

Mathlib's `omegaLimit` is the ω-limit set of a *flow* `ϕ : τ → α → α` applied to a set of initial
conditions; specialising it to a single curve would force a dummy one-point space of initial
conditions into every statement. The ω-limit set of one curve is exactly a set of cluster points,
so `Filter.MapClusterPt` is used instead, as it is in `TauCeti/Topology/ClusterSet.lean` for the
boundary cluster set — and, unlike the flow, a curve here need only be defined and continuous on a
half-line `Set.Ici a`.

Both hypotheses on the curve are needed for the two substantive statements. `u t = t` on `ℝ` has
empty ω-limit set, so confinement to a compact set is what makes it nonempty. Preconnectedness is
where continuity enters: `u t = ⌊t⌋ % 2` is confined to `{0, 1}` and has ω-limit set `{0, 1}`.

The substantive statements are proved by writing the ω-limit set as the intersection of the closed
tails `closure (u '' Ici T)`, `T ≥ a`, which is a downward directed family of compact preconnected
sets, and applying `TauCeti.isPreconnected_iInter_of_directed`.

This file is written for the Morse-theoretic
`TauCeti/Analysis/Calculus/Morse/Convergence.lean`, where the ω-limit set of a negative gradient
trajectory is shown to consist of critical points and, being preconnected inside a finite critical
locus, to be a single point.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.setOf_mapClusterPt_atTop_eq_iInter` — the ω-limit set of a curve is the intersection of
  the closures of its tails.
* `TauCeti.isPreconnected_setOf_mapClusterPt_atTop` — the ω-limit set of such a curve, continuous
  on the half-line carrying that tail, is preconnected.
* `Flow.mapClusterPt_atTop_flow` — the ω-limit set of an orbit of a flow of `ℝ` is invariant
  under the flow.

/-- **The ω-limit set of a curve is the intersection of the closures of its tails.** The
intersection may be taken over the tails starting at any time `T ≥ a`, since those still form a
basis of `atTop`; the half-line `Set.Ici a` is the domain on which the curve is later assumed
continuous. -/

/-- **The ω-limit set of a curve with a tail in a compact set is preconnected**, provided the curve
is continuous on the half-line carrying that tail. Together with
`IsCompact.exists_mapClusterPt` this makes the ω-limit set connected in the sense of `IsConnected`.
