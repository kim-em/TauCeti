# The degree of a loop in the circle

A loop `γ` in the unit circle `Circle`, based at `x`, lifts along the universal covering
`Circle.exp : ℝ → Circle`, `t ↦ e^{it}`, to a continuous angle function `θ : [0, 1] → ℝ` with
`exp (θ t) = γ t` (Mathlib's path lifting, `IsCoveringMap.liftPath`). Since the loop is closed,
`θ 1 - θ 0` is an integer multiple of `2π`, and since two continuous lifts of the same map differ
by a constant, this integer does not depend on the lift. It is the **degree** (or winding number)
`Circle.degree γ` of the loop: the number of times it runs counterclockwise around the circle.

The degree is characterized by any one continuous lift (`Circle.sub_eq_degree_mul` and
`Circle.degree_eq_of_sub_eq`), which is how it is computed in practice. It is invariant under
homotopies through loops, whose basepoint may move (`Circle.degree_eq_of_homotopy`), in particular
under homotopies of based loops (`Circle.degree_eq_of_homotopic`). It is additive under the
concatenation (`Circle.degree_trans`) and the pointwise product (`Circle.degree_mul`) of loops,
because angle functions concatenate and add, and reversing a loop negates it
(`Circle.degree_symm`). Raising a loop pointwise to the `n`-th power multiplies its degree by `n`
(`Circle.degree_map_pow`).

The degree is the integer that Tau Ceti's identification
`Circle.fundamentalGroupMulEquiv : π₁(Circle, x) ≃* Multiplicative ℤ` assigns to the class of the
loop (`Circle.fundamentalGroupMulEquiv_fromPath`); the lift description is what makes it computable
and gives its invariance under free homotopies, changes of basepoint
(`Circle.degree_symm_trans_trans`) and pointwise products. It is the invariant through
which the Maslov index of a loop of totally real subspaces is defined.

## Main declarations

* `Circle.degree`: the degree of a loop in the circle.
* `Circle.sub_eq_degree_mul`: every continuous lift `θ` of a loop satisfies
  `θ 1 - θ 0 = degree γ * (2 * π)`.
* `Circle.degree_eq_of_homotopy`: the degree is invariant under free homotopies of loops.
* `Circle.degree_symm_trans_trans`: the degree is invariant under change of basepoint.
* `Circle.degree_trans`, `Circle.degree_symm`: the degree of a concatenation of loops is the sum
  of the degrees, and reversing a loop negates its degree.
* `Circle.degree_mul`: the degree of a pointwise product of loops is the sum of the degrees.
* `Circle.degree_map_pow`: the pointwise `n`-th power of a loop has `n` times its degree.
