# Small closed balls around finitely many points are separated

Around finitely many points of a metric space, closed balls of a small enough common radius lie in
prescribed neighbourhoods of their centres and are pairwise far apart: the radius is less than
half the distance between any two distinct centres, so the balls are disjoint and no point of one
ball lies on the boundary sphere of another. This is the geometric input for splitting a sum over
points near the centres as a sum over the balls, as in the contour-integral computation of sums
over the roots of a polynomial.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.exists_pos_closedBall_subset_and_lt_dist`: a common radius that is small enough for
  every centre at once.
* `TauCeti.eq_of_dist_lt_of_dist_lt`: two such centres within the radius of a common point
  coincide.
