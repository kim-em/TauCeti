# A basis criterion for spectral maps, and transport of spectrality along an embedding

Utilities for spectral spaces and maps. A continuous map is spectral as soon as the preimage
of every member of some topological **basis** of the target is compact; and spectrality transports
from the preimage of a set to the set itself along an embedding whose range contains it.

The basis criterion first. Spectrality asks for compact preimages of all compact open sets; the
reduction to a basis is the observation that a compact open set is a *finite* union of basis
elements — cover it by the basis members it contains and extract a finite subcover — and a finite
union of compact preimages is compact.

Nothing is assumed of the basis members themselves, not even compactness: only their preimages
enter the argument. In the intended applications the basis members are the distinguished
quasi-compact opens of a spectral space (Wedhorn's family `R` for `Spv (A, I)`), whose preimages
are computed by hand.

Mathlib's `IsSpectralMap` API provides constructors from identities, compositions and embeddings,
but no criterion that tests spectrality on a basis; this supplies the missing entry point.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.isSpectralMap_of_isTopologicalBasis` : a continuous map whose preimages of basis
  members are compact is a spectral map.
* `TauCeti.isSpectralMap_eval`: a coordinate projection is spectral when every other factor
  is quasi-compact.
* `TauCeti.spectralSpace_of_isEmbedding` : a subset of the range of an embedding is spectral as
  soon as its preimage is — the transport step of any "prove it on a subspace" argument.

## References

* T. Wedhorn, *Adic Spaces*, arXiv:1910.05934v1 — Lemma 7.5(2) is the intended consumer of the
  basis criterion, and Corollary 7.12 and Theorem 7.35 of the transport lemma.

/-- **A basis criterion for spectral maps.** A continuous map is spectral as soon as the preimage
of every member of a topological basis of the target is compact: a compact open set is a finite
union of basis members, and a finite union of compact preimages is compact.

The basis members themselves need not be compact — only their preimages appear in the
hypothesis. -/

/-- Evaluation at a coordinate `i` is a spectral map as soon as every *other* factor is
quasi-compact: the preimage of a quasi-compact open is a box with that set in the `i`-th slot and
the whole space elsewhere, so only those other slots need a compactness hypothesis. -/

/-- **Spectrality transports from a trace along an embedding.** A subset of the target contained
in the range of an embedding is spectral as soon as its preimage is: the embedding restricts to a
homeomorphism between the two.

This is the shape every "prove it on a subspace and carry it back" spectrality argument takes.
It is worth stating separately because the *reason* one works on the subspace is usually that the
inclusion is not a spectral map, which makes the general preservation theorems unavailable along
it; this lemma supplies the homeomorphism route instead. -/
