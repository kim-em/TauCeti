# Filling in the bounded complementary components of a set

The **filled hull** `TauCeti.filledHull K` of a subset `K` of a topological space with a bornology
is `K` together with the bounded connected components of its complement: the points whose component
in `Kᶜ` is bounded. Points of `K` qualify vacuously, their component in `Kᶜ` being empty. Filling a
circle gives the closed disc it bounds; filling a segment, or any set whose complement is connected
and unbounded, changes nothing.

This file develops the definition and structural properties using only a topology and a bornology.
In a real seminormed space, filling preserves boundedness and diameter; these bounds are proved in
`TauCeti/Analysis/Normed/Module/FilledHull.lean`.

The trapping property `IsPreconnected.subset_filledHull` says that a preconnected set disjoint from
`K` lies inside the filled hull as soon as it meets it, since it then lies in a single bounded
component. Together with the diameter bound, it gives `IsPreconnected.diam_le_diam_of_disjoint`:
a preconnected set disjoint from a bounded `K` that meets its filled hull has diameter at most
`diam K`, without regularity assumptions on `K`.

A point lies outside the filled hull exactly when its component in the complement of `K` is
unbounded. This is the hypothesis of
`TauCeti.Contour.windingNumber_eq_zero_of_unbounded_component` in
`TauCeti/Analysis/Contour/Winding/UnboundedComponent.lean` and of its cycle form
`TauCeti.Contour.Cycle.windingNumber_eq_zero_of_unbounded_component` in
`TauCeti/Analysis/Contour/Cycle/Winding.lean`: for a closed curve with the required regularity,
or a contour cycle, the winding number vanishes outside the filled hull of its trace.

Without additional hypotheses on `K`, the hull need not be closed or connected.

## Planar enclosure

For a planar set `J`, `filledHull J \ J` consists of its bounded complementary components.
The enclosure theorem
`TauCeti.image_inter_ball_subset_filledHull_of_diam_lt_of_isPreconnected_sdiff_singleton`
combines winding-number two-sidedness with preconnectedness of `K \ {f z₀}` to place the near-side
image of a circular crosscut inside `filledHull K` when the far-side image has larger diameter
than `K`. For a Jordan curve, `TauCeti.IsJordanCurve.isPathConnected_sdiff_singleton` supplies
the required preconnectedness. These enclosure and diameter estimates are used in the
Carathéodory boundary correspondence in `TauCeti/Analysis/Complex/Conformal/Caratheodory.lean`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.filledHull` — the filled hull, and `TauCeti.subset_filledHull`,
  `TauCeti.filledHull_mono` its two structural properties.
* `TauCeti.filledHull_eq_self` — filling a set whose complement is preconnected and unbounded
  changes nothing.
* `TauCeti.filledHull_eq_self_of_isPreconnected_frontier` — an open set with preconnected frontier
  and unbounded complement has no holes: filling it changes nothing.
* `IsPreconnected.subset_filledHull` — a preconnected set disjoint from `K` that meets the
  filled hull lies in it.
* `TauCeti.subset_filledHull_of_frontier_subset` — a bounded set whose frontier `K` swallows
  lies in the filled hull, with no connectivity asked of it.

/-- The **filled hull** of a set `K`: the points whose connected component in the complement of `K`
is bounded. Equivalently, `K` together with the bounded connected components of `Kᶜ`; a point of
`K` belongs because its component in `Kᶜ` is empty. -/

/-- **A set lies in its filled hull.** For `x ∈ K` the component of `x` in `Kᶜ` is empty, and the
empty set is bounded. -/
theorem subset_filledHull : K ⊆ filledHull K := by
  intro x hx
  have hxc : x ∉ Kᶜ := by simpa using hx
  simp [mem_filledHull_iff, connectedComponentIn_eq_empty hxc]

/-- **Filling is monotone.** Enlarging `K` shrinks the complement, hence shrinks each component of
it, hence can only turn unbounded components into bounded ones. -/

/-- **Filling changes nothing when the complement is connected and unbounded.** The complement is
then a single component and that component is unbounded, so no point outside `K` is filled in. This
is the case of a segment in the plane, and of any set that does not separate the space. -/

/-- **An open set with preconnected frontier has no holes**, in a preconnected, locally connected
space: if the complement of `K` is unbounded, filling `K` changes nothing. The complement is then
preconnected (`TauCeti.isPreconnected_compl_of_isPreconnected_frontier`), so this is
`TauCeti.filledHull_eq_self`. A bounded open set of the plane whose frontier is a Jordan curve is
the basic example. -/

/-- **A preconnected set that a set cuts off from infinity lies in its filled hull.** If `S` is
preconnected and disjoint from `K`, then `S` lies in a single connected component of `Kᶜ`; meeting
the filled hull says that component is bounded, so all of `S` is in the hull. -/

  exact mem_filledHull_iff.mp hxH

/-- **A bounded set whose frontier lies in `K` is cut off from infinity by `K`.** A point of
`S \ K` lies in `interior S`, since every non-interior point of `S` lies on `frontier S ⊆ K`. Its
connected component in `Kᶜ` cannot leave `interior S`: were it to, it would meet
`frontier (interior S) ⊆ frontier S ⊆ K` by `IsPreconnected.inter_frontier_nonempty`,
while lying in `Kᶜ`. So that component is bounded because `S` is. Points of `S ∩ K` lie in the
filled hull directly.

Unlike `IsPreconnected.subset_filledHull` this asks nothing of the connectivity of `S` and
nothing about the hull being met, at the price of asking `K` to swallow the whole frontier — the
same trade as between `TauCeti.diam_le_diam_of_frontier_subset` and
`IsPreconnected.diam_le_diam_of_disjoint`. -/
