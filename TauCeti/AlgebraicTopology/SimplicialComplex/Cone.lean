# Cones of simplicial complexes

The cone on a simplicial complex `K` is its join with a single vertex.  Its vertex type is
`α ⊕ PUnit`: the left summand contains the original vertices and `Sum.inr PUnit.unit` is the
apex.  A face is therefore either an original face, tagged into the left summand, or an original
face together with the apex; the apex by itself is also a face.

Cones are elementary infrastructure for layer 11 of the geometric-topology roadmap.  Recursive
combinatorial balls are obtained by coning combinatorial spheres, and suspensions are formed by
iterated coning/gluing.  This file supplies the combinatorial operation and its face API, building
entirely on the join construction already available in Tau Ceti.

The file also records that the construction satisfies the internal cone condition
`PreAbstractSimplicialComplex.IsCone` at its apex (`isCone_cone`), which is what
identifies the two accounts of a cone.

The construction follows Rourke--Sanderson, *Introduction to Piecewise-Linear Topology*, Chapter
2.  No result from that source is used beyond the standard definition of a cone as a join with a
point.

## Main definitions

* `PreAbstractSimplicialComplex.cone`: the cone on a pre-abstract simplicial complex.
* `AbstractSimplicialComplex.cone`: the cone on an abstract simplicial complex.

## Main results

* `mem_cone_iff`: a face of the cone is nonempty and has either an empty base projection or a
  face of the original complex as its base projection.
* `map_inl_mem_cone`: every original face is a face of the cone.
* `apex_mem_cone`: the apex is a face.
* `disjSum_singleton_mem_cone`: adjoining the apex to an original face gives a face.
* `cone_mono`: coning is monotone.
* `finite_faces_cone`: the cone on a finite complex is finite.
* `isCone_cone`: the cone construction is a cone with apex the adjoined vertex.
