# Combinatorial zero-balls and zero-spheres

A combinatorial zero-ball is exactly a single vertex, and a combinatorial zero-sphere is
exactly two distinct vertices, with no higher faces. These characterizations identify the base
cases of the sphere-or-ball link condition without requiring callers to unpack stellar move
sequences. In particular, the link of a vertex in a combinatorial one-manifold has one or two
vertices, corresponding to a boundary or interior point.

The definitions use stellar equivalence rather than a literal standard model. Their necessity
follows from preservation of dimension and, in dimension zero, of face cardinality under every
stellar move and injective relabeling.
