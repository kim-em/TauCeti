# The compact cores of the thrice-punctured sphere

For `ρ > 0`, the *compact core* `compactCore ρ` of `ℂ ∖ {0, 1}` is the set of points at distance
at least `ρ` from each of the three punctures, measured in the standard local coordinate `z`,
`1 - z` or `1 / z` at `0`, `1` or `∞`:

  `compactCore ρ = {z | ρ ≤ ‖z‖ ∧ ρ ≤ ‖z - 1‖ ∧ ‖z‖ ≤ ρ⁻¹}`.

It is compact, and every compact subset of `ℂ ∖ {0, 1}` lies in one of them, so the complements
of the compact cores form a basis of the cocompact filter: going to infinity in `ℂ ∖ {0, 1}`
means approaching one of the three punctures. The core of radius `1 / 2` is the complement of
the three standard punctured neighbourhoods.

A finite cover of `ℂ ∖ {0, 1}` is a proper map, so the preimage of every compact core is compact.
This is the compactness input for filling in the punctures of a finite cover: for small `ρ > 0`,
the cover is the union of the compact preimage of `compactCore ρ` and of its parts over the closed
punctured discs `0 < ‖w‖ ≤ ρ` in the coordinates `w` at `0`, `1` and `∞`. In the filling charts,
each of these parts becomes a finite union of closed discs, hence compact, once its centres are
added.
