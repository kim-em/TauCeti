# The deck group of the antipodal cover of real projective space

The unit sphere `Sⁿ` covers real projective `n`-space as the quotient by the antipodal
action of `ℤˣ`; `TauCeti.RealProjectiveSpace.isQuotientCoveringMap_mk` records this. This
file identifies the deck transformation group of that cover.

The antipodal map is always a deck transformation, and it is never the identity because no
unit vector is its own negative. Both facts are unconditional, and come from
`TauCeti.Deck.IsQuotientCoveringMap.toDeckHom`, which turns an element of the acting group of
a quotient covering map into a deck transformation, together with its injectivity
`TauCeti.Deck.IsQuotientCoveringMap.toDeckHom_injective`.

For `1 ≤ n` the sphere is connected, so a deck transformation is determined by its value at a
single point, and `TauCeti.Deck.IsQuotientCoveringMap.deckMulEquiv` identifies the whole deck
group with the two-element acting group:

  `deck (mk n) ≃* ℤˣ`.

The regularity of the antipodal cover needs no connectedness hypothesis.

For `n = 0` the sphere is the two-point space `S⁰`, which is disconnected, so the argument
does not apply; the statements that need it carry the hypothesis `1 ≤ n` explicitly.

For a regular cover the deck group is a quotient of the fundamental group of the base, so
knowing that the antipodal cover is regular with deck group of order two is the covering-space
input to the computation of `π₁(RPⁿ)`.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.RealProjectiveSpace.antipode`: the antipodal map as a deck transformation of the
  cover `Sⁿ → RPⁿ`.
* `TauCeti.RealProjectiveSpace.antipode_ne_one`: it is not the identity.
* `TauCeti.RealProjectiveSpace.deckMulEquiv`: for `1 ≤ n`, the deck group of the antipodal
  cover is `ℤˣ`.
* `TauCeti.RealProjectiveSpace.eq_one_or_eq_antipode`: for `1 ≤ n`, a deck transformation of
  the antipodal cover is the identity or the antipodal map.
* `TauCeti.RealProjectiveSpace.card_deck`: for `1 ≤ n`, the deck group has two elements.
* `TauCeti.RealProjectiveSpace.isRegular_mk`: the antipodal cover is regular.
