# Numbered, pointed and bare connected covers of degree `n`

A connected cover of degree `n` over a basepoint `x` can be rigidified in three ways, and each
rigidification has its own notion of isomorphism:

* a **fibre-numbered** cover `TauCeti.ConnectedFiberNumberedCover x n` carries a numbering
  `ν : p ⁻¹' {x} ≃ Fin n` of the fibre, and its isomorphisms preserve the label of every point of
  the fibre;
* a **pointed** cover `TauCeti.ConnectedPointedCover x n` carries one point of the fibre, and its
  isomorphisms preserve that point;
* a **bare** cover `TauCeti.ConnectedCover x n` carries neither, and its isomorphisms are all
  isomorphisms of covers.

All three are built on `TauCeti.ConnectedCoveringSpace X`. The degree is a parameter rather than
something recovered afterwards: it is the cardinality of the fibre over `x`, recorded by the
numbering itself or by the existence of one. Isomorphism is an equivalence relation in each case,
and the three types of isomorphism classes are the quotients
`TauCeti.ConnectedFiberNumberedCoverClass`, `TauCeti.ConnectedPointedCoverClass` and
`TauCeti.ConnectedCoverClass`.

The rigidifications are related by forgetful maps — forgetting the numbering, keeping only the
point with a given label, forgetting the point — which descend to isomorphism classes and form a
commuting triangle. The symmetric group `Equiv.Perm (Fin n)` acts on numberings by relabelling,
`τ • ν = ν.trans τ`. The forgetful maps have these orbit descriptions:

* two numbered classes have the same underlying cover exactly when they differ by a relabelling,
  so the bare classes are the relabelling orbits of the numbered ones
  (`TauCeti.ConnectedFiberNumberedCoverClass.orbitRelQuotientEquiv`);
* two marked numbered classes give the same pointed class exactly when a relabelling carries one
  to the other and carries its marked label to the other label, so the pointed classes are the
  orbits of the diagonal action on numbered classes paired with a label
  (`TauCeti.ConnectedFiberNumberedCoverClass.markedOrbitRelQuotientEquiv`).

These are the covering-space counterparts of the passage from literal permutation triples to
their simultaneous-conjugacy classes (`TauCeti.ConnectedIsoClass`) and to marked triples modulo
the diagonal action: a classification of numbered covers that is equivariant for relabelling
therefore descends to the other two rigidifications.

Over a path-connected base the degree does not depend on the basepoint, and over a preconnected
base a connected cover has positive degree.

The basepoint can be moved. A bare cover at `x₀` is a bare cover at any point of the connected
component of `x₀`, with no choice involved. A numbered cover is moved along a path `γ` from `x₀` to
`x₁`: lifting `γ` identifies the two fibres, so the numbering of the fibre over `x₀` induces one of
the fibre over `x₁`, and the numbered monodromy of `π₁(X, x₁)` is that of `π₁(X, x₀)` read through
the change of basepoint along `γ`.

Over a path-connected, locally path-connected base, a numbered cover is determined up to
isomorphism by its monodromy representation read through the numbering,
`π₁(X, x) →* Equiv.Perm (Fin n)`: taking the fibre over `x` with its monodromy action is faithful
and full (`TauCeti.CoveringSpace.fiberActionFunctor_faithful`,
`TauCeti.CoveringSpace.fiberActionFunctor_full`), and the numberings turn equal representations
into an isomorphism of `π₁(X, x)`-sets preserving the labels.

Conversely, over a locally path-connected, semilocally simply connected base, every
representation `π₁(X, x) →* Equiv.Perm (Fin n)` with `n ≠ 0` and transitive image is the numbered
monodromy of some numbered cover: the realisation theorem for transitive fundamental-group sets
(`TauCeti.ConnectedCoveringSpace.exists_fiberAction_iso`) supplies a connected cover whose fibre
is equivariantly identified with the finite set, and that identification is a numbering.

A deck transformation of a numbered cover permutes the fibre, hence the labels
(`TauCeti.ConnectedFiberNumberedCover.deckPerm`). Over a preconnected base this determines the deck
transformation, and over a path-connected, locally path-connected base the permutations so obtained
are exactly those commuting with the numbered monodromy: a permutation `τ` commuting with it leaves
the numbered monodromy of the relabelled cover unchanged, so some isomorphism from the cover to its
relabelling preserves every label, and that isomorphism is a deck transformation inducing `τ`.
Relabelling the fibre conjugates the induced permutations.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.ConnectedFiberNumberedCover`, `TauCeti.ConnectedPointedCover`,
  `TauCeti.ConnectedCover`: the three carriers.

  relations of numbered and pointed covers, with setoids
  `TauCeti.connectedFiberNumberedCoverSetoid` and `TauCeti.connectedPointedCoverSetoid`. Bare covers
  are related by `CategoryTheory.IsIsomorphic` of their underlying covers, with setoid
  `TauCeti.connectedCoverSetoid`.

* `TauCeti.ConnectedFiberNumberedCoverClass.forgetNumbering_eq_forgetNumbering_iff` and
  `TauCeti.ConnectedFiberNumberedCoverClass.orbitRelQuotientEquiv`: bare classes are relabelling
  orbits of numbered classes.
* `TauCeti.ConnectedFiberNumberedCoverClass.markLabel_eq_markLabel_iff` and
  `TauCeti.ConnectedFiberNumberedCoverClass.markedOrbitRelQuotientEquiv`: pointed classes are
  diagonal orbits of marked numbered classes.
* `TauCeti.ConnectedCover.nonempty_equiv_fin_of_mem_connectedComponent`: the degree is the same
  over the whole connected component of the base point;
  `TauCeti.ConnectedCover.ne_zero`: over a preconnected base the degree is positive.
* `TauCeti.ConnectedFiberNumberedCover.basepointChange`, `TauCeti.ConnectedCover.basepointChange`,
  `TauCeti.ConnectedCoverClass.basepointChange`: moving the basepoint, with
  `TauCeti.ConnectedFiberNumberedCover.permCongrHom_comp_monodromyPerm_basepointChange` computing
  the numbered monodromy of the moved cover.
* `TauCeti.connectedFiberNumberedCoverIso_iff_permCongrHom_comp_monodromyPerm_eq`: two numbered
  covers are isomorphic exactly when their numbered monodromy representations agree.
* `TauCeti.ConnectedFiberNumberedCover.exists_permCongrHom_comp_monodromyPerm_eq`: over a
  semilocally simply connected base, every transitive representation on `Fin n` is the numbered
  monodromy of some numbered cover.
* `TauCeti.ConnectedFiberNumberedCover.deckPerm`: the permutation of the labels induced by a deck
  transformation, with `deckPerm_injective` and `deckPerm_smul`.
