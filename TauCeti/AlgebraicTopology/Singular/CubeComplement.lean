# The complement of an embedded cube is acyclic

If `h : Iᵏ → Sⁿ` is an embedding of a cube into a sphere, then the complement `Sⁿ ∖ h(Iᵏ)` has
the reduced singular homology of a point. This is the first half of Hatcher's Proposition 2B.1;
the second half, that the complement of an embedded `k`-sphere has the reduced homology of an
`(n - k - 1)`-sphere, follows from it by the same Mayer–Vietoris argument, and with it the
Jordan–Brouwer separation theorem: an embedded `(n - 1)`-sphere separates `Sⁿ` into exactly two
path components.

The proof works in any Hausdorff space `Y` in which the complement of every point has vanishing
reduced homology, by induction on `k`. Write `Iᵏ⁺¹ = I × Iᵏ` and, for `s ⊆ I`, let `W s` be the
complement of the image of the slab `s × Iᵏ`. By induction, `W {t}` is acyclic for every `t`. A
class `α` of `W I` therefore vanishes in `W J` for every short enough interval `J` around a point,
since a singular cycle has compact support (`TauCeti.exists_singularHomologyMap_inclusion_eq_zero`),
and if it vanishes in `W [a, b]` and `W [b, c]` then it vanishes in `W [a, c]`, by the
Mayer–Vietoris sequence of `W [a, c] = W [a, b] ∩ W [b, c]` inside `W {b}`
(`TopCat.eq_zero_of_comp_reducedSingularHomologyFunctor_map_inclusion`). Hatcher concludes by
repeated bisection; here the set of `s` with `α` vanishing in `W [0, s]` is shown to be open and
closed in `I`, hence all of it.

Coefficients are a module over a ring, since the compactness step is an argument about elements.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.isZero_reducedSingularHomologyFunctor_compl_range_cube`: in a Hausdorff space whose
  point complements are acyclic, the complement of an embedded cube is acyclic.
* `TauCeti.isZero_reducedSingularHomologyFunctor_sphere_compl_range_cube`: the complement of a cube
  embedded in the unit sphere of a real normed space is acyclic.
* `TauCeti.isZero_reducedSingularHomologyFunctor_compl_range_closedBall`: the same for an embedded
  closed disc, which is homeomorphic to a cube.

By compactness, a class `α` of the complement of the cube vanishes in the complement of the slab
over a short enough interval around any point, and by the Mayer–Vietoris sequence its vanishing
over two adjacent intervals implies its vanishing over their union. So the set of `s` for which `α`
vanishes over `[0, s]` is open and closed, hence all of `I`. -/
