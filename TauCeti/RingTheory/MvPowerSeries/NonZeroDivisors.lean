# The difference of two variables is a non-zero-divisor

Mathlib shows that a *single* variable is a non-zero-divisor over an arbitrary semiring
(`MvPowerSeries.X_mem_nonZeroDivisors`), and that `MvPowerSeries σ R` inherits `NoZeroDivisors`
from `R`. Between those lies a gap: over a ring that *has* zero divisors, is `X i - X j` still
regular? It is, and this file proves it.

## Main results

* `MvPowerSeries.X_sub_X_mem_nonZeroDivisors`: for `i ≠ j`, the difference `X i - X j` is a
  non-zero-divisor of `MvPowerSeries σ R` over an arbitrary commutative ring.

## Implementation notes

The proof is a coefficient recursion rather than a cancellation in `R`, which is what lets the
hypotheses on `R` drop. Reading `f * (X i - X j) = 0` at the exponent `d + single i 1` gives
`coeff d f = coeff (d + single i 1 - single j 1) f` when `d j ≠ 0`, and `coeff d f = 0` when
`d j = 0`, since the `X j` term is then absent for degree reasons. Each step lowers the
`j`-exponent by one, so induction on `d j` walks every coefficient down to that base case.

/-- **The difference of two distinct variables is a non-zero-divisor**, over an arbitrary
commutative ring: `f * (X i - X j) = 0` forces `f = 0`, with no hypothesis on `R`.

Compare `MvPowerSeries.X_mem_nonZeroDivisors`, the same statement for a single variable, and the
`NoZeroDivisors (MvPowerSeries σ R)` instance, which requires `R` to have no zero divisors. -/
