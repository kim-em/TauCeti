# Trace and norm in quadratic algebras and separable quadratic extensions

For a separable quadratic extension `L/K` the trace and norm are the two elementary symmetric
functions of the pair `{x, σx}`, where `σ` is the nontrivial automorphism: `tr x = x + σx` and
`N x = x · σx` (`algebraMap_trace_eq_add`, `algebraMap_norm_eq_mul`). These give the
discriminant characterisation of the generators:

* `discrim_eq_zero_iff_mem_range_algebraMap`: the discriminant `t² - 4n` of `X² - tX + n`, the
  characteristic polynomial of multiplication by `θ`, vanishes exactly when `θ ∈ K`. (That
  polynomial is the *minimal* polynomial of `θ` precisely when `θ ∉ K`, which is what the
  statement says.) Forwards the discriminant equals `(θ - σθ)²`, so it vanishes only where `σ`
  fixes `θ`; `discrim_ne_zero` is the contrapositive, kept separately because it is the
  direction consumers use;
* `exists_discrim_ne_zero` turns that into a choice principle: some `θ` has nonzero
  discriminant, hence generates. This is what a construction over `L/K` picks its generator by.

Three results hold for a commutative quadratic algebra over any nontrivial commutative base
ring `K`, including bases with zero divisors. `Algebra.IsQuadraticExtension K L` supplies
freeness and rank two; module-finiteness follows from the positive rank. No Euclidean division,
domain, or separability hypothesis is needed. This covers quadratic orders over `ℤ`, the split
algebra `K × K`, and the non-reduced `K[X]/(X²)`:

* `trace_algebraMap_add_algebraMap_mul` and `norm_algebraMap_add_algebraMap_mul` evaluate the
  trace and norm of `b + aθ` — the first by `K`-linearity of the trace, the second from the
  `2 × 2` identity `det (b • 1 + a • M) = b² + ab · tr M + a² · det M`. This is how a statement
  about one generator transfers to another;
* `discrim_eq_zero_of_mem_range_algebraMap`, the easy half of the characterisation: a scalar
  `θ = c` has `t = 2c` and `n = c²`, so `t² - 4n = 0`.

Separability is genuinely needed for the other half, and hence for `discrim_ne_zero` and
`exists_discrim_ne_zero`: over a purely inseparable quadratic extension the trace form vanishes,
so `t = 0` and `t² - 4n = 0` for *every* `θ`. In characteristic two `discrim_ne_zero` says
`t ≠ 0`, reflecting that a separable quadratic extension is then Artin–Schreier rather than
Kummer.

These formulas support quadratic twists and computations of norms in quadratic number fields.
The nonzero-discriminant criterion selects a generator for a separable quadratic extension
and ensures that twisting by that generator preserves ellipticity.

Over a base field, a square root `x` of `d ∈ K` with `x ∉ K` has characteristic polynomial
`X² - d`, in every commutative quadratic algebra:

* `trace_eq_zero_of_sq_eq` and `norm_eq_neg_of_sq_eq`: `Tr x = 0` and `N x = -d`;
* `trace_algebraMap_add_algebraMap_mul_of_sq_eq` and
  `norm_algebraMap_add_algebraMap_mul_of_sq_eq`: in square-root coordinates
  `Tr (b + a x) = 2b` and `N (b + a x) = b² - a² d`.

In a quadratic field extension `trace_inv` gives `Tr (a⁻¹) = Tr a / N a`, with no separability
hypothesis. These are the inputs to the diagonalization of the twisted trace forms
`y ↦ Tr (a y²)` of a quadratic extension.
