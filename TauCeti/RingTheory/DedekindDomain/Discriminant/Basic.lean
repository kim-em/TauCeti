# Relative discriminant ideals

For a finite torsion-free extension `A → B` of Dedekind domains, the relative discriminant is the
ideal of `A` obtained by taking the relative norm of Mathlib's different ideal of `B`. This file
introduces that carrier, together with the two defining identities that are valid without a
separability assumption. The later arithmetic theory uses `relDiscr` rather than expanding this
relative norm of the different at each use site.
