# The cyclotomic polynomials, computably

Mathlib defines `Polynomial.cyclotomic n R` through the primitive `n`-th roots of unity in `ℂ`,
so nothing about it evaluates: `Polynomial` is a `Finsupp` and `cyclotomic` is `noncomputable`.
This file computes the coefficients of `Φ_n` over `ℤ` instead, and proves that the computation is
right.

The algorithm is the defining recursion `∏_{d ∣ n} Φ_d = X ^ n - 1` read as a division: starting
from the coefficients of `X ^ n - 1`, divide successively by `Φ_d` for each proper divisor `d` of
`n`, each of which is monic and already computed, and what is left is `Φ_n`.  The divisions are
the synthetic division of `TauCeti.Polynomial.divByMonicList`; the recursion is made structural by
passing a fuel argument, so that `TauCeti.cyclotomicCoeffs` reduces in the kernel, as the closing
examples check.

`TauCeti.cyclotomicCoeffs_eq_coeffList` identifies the computed list with Mathlib's
`Polynomial.coeffList` of `Polynomial.cyclotomic n ℤ`, so it is not merely *a* list of
coefficients for `Φ_n` but *the* one: leading coefficient first, with no leading zeros.

This is the arithmetic that the executable Burnside--Dixon--Schneider character-table algorithm
computes in: the exact cyclotomic integers `ℤ[ζ_e] = ℤ[X]/Φ_e` are coefficient vectors on the
power basis, and reducing a product modulo `Φ_e` needs the coefficients of `Φ_e` themselves.
