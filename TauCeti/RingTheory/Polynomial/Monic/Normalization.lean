# Integral normalization in coefficient coordinates

The lower coefficients of the integral normalization of a nonzero degree `n` polynomial `f`
are `f.coeff i * f.leadingCoeff ^ (n - 1 - i)`. Expressing the normalization through
`monicOfCoeff` makes sense even when these coefficients specialize to a lower-degree polynomial:
the monic leading term is retained. This is the coefficient construction needed to normalize
analytic families across a vanishing leading coefficient.

`Polynomial.isRoot_integralNormalization_mul_iff` recovers the original root equation from
a normalized root scaled by the leading coefficient, including zero and constant polynomials.
The same scaling preserves root multiplicities
(`Polynomial.rootMultiplicity_integralNormalization_mul`).
`Polynomial.integralNormalization_eq_prod_X_sub_C` transports a complete linear
factorization, including repeated roots, to the normalized polynomial.
