# Computable cyclotomic integers

This file defines `TauCeti.Cyclotomic e`, an exact, computable model of
`ℤ[X] / (Polynomial.cyclotomic e ℤ)`.  Its elements are the `e.totient` coefficients of the
canonical representative, in descending order; `TauCeti.Cyclotomic.coeff` reads off the coordinate
of a single power of `ζ`.  Addition, negation, multiplication, and equality are genuine
computations on finite lists of integers; multiplication convolves coefficient lists with
`TauCeti.Polynomial.mulCoeffList` and then applies the computable cyclotomic reduction from
`TauCeti.RingTheory.Polynomial.Cyclotomic.Computable`.

The coefficient accessor is additive (`TauCeti.Cyclotomic.coeffAddHom`), and integer scalar
multiplication scales each coordinate (`TauCeti.Cyclotomic.coeff_intCast_mul`).

The ring is identified with Mathlib's `AdjoinRoot (Polynomial.cyclotomic e ℤ)`.  For nonzero `e`,
evaluation at `exp (2 * π * I / e)` then gives the distinguished embedding into `ℂ` used to state
the correctness of exact character-table computations.

A ring homomorphism out of `Cyclotomic e` is determined by the image of `ζ`
(`TauCeti.Cyclotomic.ringHom_ext`).  Evaluating at a root of the cyclotomic polynomial gives a ring
homomorphism (`TauCeti.Cyclotomic.evalRingHom`); `TauCeti.Cyclotomic.evalCoeffs` evaluates a
coefficient list by Horner's rule.  Evaluation specialises to the reduction modulo a prime `p` at a
primitive `e`-th root in `ZMod p` (`TauCeti.Cyclotomic.reduce`, bundled as
`TauCeti.Cyclotomic.reduceRingHom`) and to the complex embedding
`TauCeti.Cyclotomic.complexEmbedding`, which is injective
(`TauCeti.Cyclotomic.complexEmbedding_injective`).
