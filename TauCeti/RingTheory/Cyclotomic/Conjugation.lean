# Complex conjugation on exact cyclotomic integers

For positive `e`, complex conjugation preserves `ℤ[ζ_e]` and is determined by
`ζ_e ↦ ζ_e⁻¹ = ζ_e ^ (e - 1)`.  This file implements that substitution directly on the
coefficient-vector type `TauCeti.Cyclotomic e`, proves that it agrees with complex conjugation
under the distinguished embedding into `ℂ`, and equips the exact ring with its canonical
star-ring structure.

The operation is a genuine computation: it evaluates the canonical coefficient list at
`ζ_e ^ (e - 1)` using `TauCeti.Cyclotomic.evalCoeffs`.  In particular, exact Hermitian products
can be checked before any passage to `ℂ`; this is needed by the cyclotomic stage of the
Burnside--Dixon--Schneider character-table solver.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.Cyclotomic.instStar`: computable conjugation on exact cyclotomic integers, given by the
  substitution `ζ_e ↦ ζ_e ^ (e - 1)`.
* `TauCeti.Cyclotomic.instStarRing`: the canonical star-ring structure for positive conductor.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Cyclotomic.star_def`: `star` evaluates the canonical coefficient vector at
  `ζ_e ^ (e - 1)`.
* `TauCeti.Cyclotomic.star_zeta`: conjugation sends `ζ_e` to `ζ_e ^ (e - 1)`.
* `TauCeti.Cyclotomic.complexEmbedding_star`: the distinguished complex embedding intertwines
  exact and complex conjugation.
* `TauCeti.Cyclotomic.reduce_star`: reducing a conjugate at a cyclotomic root `r` is reduction of
  the original exact integer at `r ^ (e - 1)`.

`ζ_e` by `ζ_e ^ (e - 1)`.  For positive `e` this power is `ζ_e⁻¹`, so the substitution is complex
