# Bounds on a valuation at a topologically nilpotent element

**Wedhorn, *Adic Spaces* (arXiv:1910.05934v1), Theorem 7.10 and Remark 7.11(1), in the
directions that need no Huber-ring hypothesis.**

Topological nilpotence sends the powers of `a` into every neighbourhood of `0`, so as soon as a
ball `{x | v x < γ}` is a neighbourhood of `0`, some power `v a ^ n` drops below `γ` — the shared
step `exists_pow_lt_of_isTopologicallyNilpotent`. Two different hypotheses put a ball in `𝓝 0`
— continuity of `v`, or a full characteristic group together with the unit ball being a
neighbourhood of `0` — and this file records the bounds Theorem 7.10 asks for under each. They
are *not* the same statement and do not need the same hypotheses.

* `v a < 1`, from continuity. The threshold `1 = v 1` is a value `v` attains, so the ball is
  open by the definition of continuity alone: no compatibility between the topology and the ring
  operations is used, and the codomain need only be a `LinearOrderedCommMonoidWithZero`.
* `v a` is **cofinal** in the value group `Γ_v`: for every `γ ∈ Γ_v` some power `v a ^ n` falls
  below `γ`. This is strictly stronger and costs strictly more, for the reason below, and it is
  recorded on both routes: from continuity, and from `Γ_v = cΓ_v` with the unit ball a
  neighbourhood of `0`.

## The value group, not the codomain

Cofinality quantifies over `Γ_v`, the subgroup of the codomain *generated* by the attained
values, so a general `γ` is a **ratio** `v r / v t`, which need not be attained. That is what
`Valuation.IsContinuous.isOpen_lt_div` supplies, and it is why the continuity route reaches for
the ratio form of continuity rather than the attained-value one: `{x | v x < γ}` has to be a
neighbourhood of `0` for the ratios too before topological nilpotence can be applied to it.
Mathlib's `Valuation.exists_div_eq_of_unit` is what puts a general element of `Γ_v` in that
form. The characteristic-group route instead bounds `γ` below by an attained inverse
(`HasFullCharacteristicGroup.exists_inv_le`) and pulls the unit ball back along multiplication
by the attaining element.

## Why `lt_one` is not just the case `γ = 1`

Cofinality does imply `v a < 1`, through `cofinalValueFor_top_iff` and `CofinalValueFor.lt_one`.
But that route pays for the general `γ`: a group codomain, and continuity of right multiplication
for the ratios. Since `Spv (A, I·A)` membership is a condition on all of `Γ_v` while the second
conjunct of Theorem 7.10 is a condition on `1` alone, the two really are separate obligations,
and the second is recorded at its own — much weaker — hypotheses rather than as a corollary of
the first.

## Main results

* `Valuation.exists_pow_lt_of_isTopologicallyNilpotent`
* `Valuation.IsContinuous.lt_one_of_isTopologicallyNilpotent`
* `Valuation.IsContinuous.cofinalValue_of_isTopologicallyNilpotent`
* `Valuation.HasFullCharacteristicGroup.cofinalValue_of_isTopologicallyNilpotent` :
  cofinality again, with continuity replaced by a full characteristic group plus the open unit
  ball being a neighbourhood of `0` — the `Γ_v = cΓ_v` branch of Theorem 7.10's converse.
* `IsTopologicallyNilpotent.valuation_lt_one` : for the canonical valuation of a valuative topology
  (`IsValuativeTopology`), whose open unit ball is a neighbourhood of `0`, a topologically
  nilpotent element has valuation `< 1`.
* `TauCeti.isTopologicallyNilpotent_iff_valuation_lt_one` : when moreover the value group is
  archimedean, the converse holds too, so topological nilpotence is exactly the open unit ball.

  `ValuativeRel`-derived valuation, and its general-`γ` counterpart
  `cont_to_ideal_le_supp_microbial` is an explicit `sorry` gated on a microbiality hypothesis.
  Neither result here needs microbiality, and the hypotheses differ; nothing was copied.

/-- **The shared step.** If the ball of radius `γ` is a neighbourhood of `0` and `a` is
topologically nilpotent, some power of `v a` falls below `γ`.

Every bound in this file is this lemma at a different threshold, so it is stated once, at the
monoid level, with the neighbourhood supplied rather than derived: nothing here needs a group
codomain or any compatibility between the topology and the ring operations. No positivity of `γ`
is assumed — a neighbourhood of `0` contains `0`, which already places `v 0 = 0` below `γ`. -/

/-- **The second conjunct of Wedhorn Theorem 7.10.** A continuous valuation is `< 1` at every
topologically nilpotent element.

The threshold `1` is the attained value `v 1`, so the ball `{x | v x < 1}` is open straight from
the definition of continuity: nothing relates the topology to the ring operations, and the
codomain is only a monoid.

`Nontrivial Γ₀` is not decoration. If `0 = 1` in `Γ₀` then `Γ₀` is trivial, every `{x | v x < v b}`
is empty and so open, and the conclusion `v a < 1` reads `0 < 0`; a group codomain rules this out
by fiat, a monoid one does not. -/

/-- **Wedhorn Remark 7.11(1), the direction that holds for any topological ring.** A continuous
valuation has cofinal values at every topologically nilpotent element: the powers of `a` are
eventually inside each ball `{x | v x < γ}`, and continuity is what makes that ball open.

A general `γ ∈ Γ_v` is a ratio `v r / v t` of attained values, which need not be attained, so
the ball is opened by `IsContinuous.isOpen_lt_div` — whence `[ContinuousConstSMul Aᵐᵒᵖ A]`,
which is continuity of right multiplication by a constant and nothing more. -/
