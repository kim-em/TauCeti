# The Krull-Schmidt theorem for external direct sums

`TauCeti.exists_indecomposable_decomposition` and
`TauCeti.exists_equiv_linearEquiv_of_iSupIndep` state the two halves of the Krull-Schmidt theorem
for families of *submodules* of one fixed module. A client that starts from an external
decomposition `M ≃ₗ[A] ⨁ i, N i`, with the summands `N i` abstract modules of their own, cannot
apply them without first transporting every summand into the submodule lattice of `M` and rebuilding
the independence data by hand. This file does that transport once and restates both halves against
external direct sums.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.exists_iSupIndep_linearEquiv_of_directSum`: an external decomposition
  `M ≃ₗ[A] ⨁ i, N i` induces an internal one, a family of submodules of `M` that is `iSupIndep`,
  spans `M`, and whose `i`-th member is isomorphic to `N i`. This is the transport the two theorems
  below run on, and it is stated separately because it is what a client needs in order to reach any
  other statement about internal decompositions.
* `TauCeti.IsIndecomposableModule.exists_nonempty_linearEquiv_of_directSum`: an indecomposable
  module isomorphic to `⨁ i, N i` is isomorphic to one of the summands `N i`.
* `TauCeti.exists_linearEquiv_directSum_isIndecomposableModule`: **existence**, externally: an
  Artinian module is isomorphic to a direct sum of indecomposable modules.
* `TauCeti.exists_equiv_linearEquiv_of_directSum`: **the Krull-Schmidt theorem**, externally: two
  decompositions `M ≃ₗ[A] ⨁ i, N i` and `M ≃ₗ[A] ⨁ j, Q j` of a module of finite length into
  indecomposable summands are matched by a bijection `ι ≃ κ` under which corresponding summands are
  isomorphic, with `TauCeti.exists_equiv_linearEquiv_of_directSum_of_isLocalRing_end` in Azumaya's
  generality and `TauCeti.card_eq_card_of_directSum` for the number of summands.
* `TauCeti.exists_equiv_linearEquiv_of_directSumEquiv`: the same for two abstract families of
  summands compared by an isomorphism `(⨁ i, N i) ≃ₗ[A] ⨁ j, Q j`, with no ambient module.

## Implementation notes

The transport goes through `LinearMap.range (DirectSum.lof A ι N i)`, the copy of `N i` inside
`⨁ i, N i`. That these ranges span is Mathlib's `DFinsupp.iSup_range_lsingle`, `DirectSum.lof`
being by definition `DFinsupp.lsingle`; that they are
independent is the one private lemma below, read off the components. Their images under `e.symm`
are the internal decomposition of `M`, independent by `LinearMap.iSupIndep_map`. The transport is
stated existentially rather than as a named family of submodules, so that `DecidableEq ι` — which
`DirectSum.lof` needs but no statement here does — can be produced by `classical` inside the proof
instead of appearing as a hypothesis. This matches the choice made in
`TauCeti/RingTheory/KrullSchmidt/Uniqueness.lean` to spell decompositions as `iSupIndep` together
with `⨆ i, P i = ⊤` rather than as `DirectSum.IsInternal`.

Comparing two abstract families `N` and `Q` directly, with no ambient module, is the case
`M := ⨁ i, N i`, taking the first equivalence to be `LinearEquiv.refl`; that is
`TauCeti.exists_equiv_linearEquiv_of_directSumEquiv`. The statements are given with an ambient `M`
rather than only in that special case because the finiteness hypothesis is then read on the direct
sum itself, which is not where a client holds it.

The transport lemmas need no subtraction, so they are stated for a semimodule over a semiring; the
decomposition theorems are over a ring, which is the generality of the internal statements they
consume.

## References

This supplies the external interface to Layer 2 ("the Krull-Schmidt theorem") of
`TauCetiRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/QuiverRepresentations/README.md`, whose uniqueness bullet asks
for the theorem to be proved "at the module level with submodules and linear equivalences", then
transported.
