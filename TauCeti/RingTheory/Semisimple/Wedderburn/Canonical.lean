# The intrinsic data of a Wedderburn block

Artin--Wedderburn presents a semisimple ring `R` as a finite product of matrix rings over division
rings, `R ≃+* ∏ᵢ Matₙᵢ(Dᵢ)`, and `RingEquiv.wedderburn_blocks_unique` says that two presentations
differ only by a permutation of the blocks.  That is uniqueness *between* presentations; it does
not say what the surviving data `nᵢ` and `Dᵢ` **are**.  This file answers that: each block is the
block of a simple `R`-module `S`, and then

* its coefficient division ring is `TauCeti.blockDivisionRing R S`, the opposite endomorphism ring
  `(Module.End R S)ᵐᵒᵖ`, which is a division ring by Schur's lemma, and
* its matrix size is `TauCeti.blockMultiplicity R S`, the number of copies of `S` in the regular
  module.

Both are defined directly from the isomorphism class of `S`, with no presentation in sight, so
`TauCeti.WedderburnPresentation.exists_equiv_degree_eq_blockMultiplicity` turns "the degrees" and
"the division rings" of a semisimple ring into well-defined objects rather than artefacts of a
chosen decomposition.

## The multiplicity

The `S`-isotypic component of the regular module is `isotypicComponent R R S`, the sum of the left
ideals isomorphic to `S`; over a semisimple ring it is a finite direct sum of copies of `S`, and
`TauCeti.blockMultiplicity R S` is defined as its length, so it is manifestly an invariant of the
isomorphism class of `S` (`TauCeti.blockMultiplicity_eq_of_linearEquiv`).  Taking the length rather
than an exponent read off a chosen decomposition is what makes the definition choice-free;
`TauCeti.blockMultiplicity_eq_of_linearEquiv_fun` recovers the exponent from any decomposition.

## A presentation realizing the intrinsic block data

Mathlib's `IsSemisimpleRing.exists_ringEquiv_pi_matrix_end_mulOpposite` already presents `R` with
the intrinsic coefficient rings `(Module.End R (S i))ᵐᵒᵖ`, but its existential keeps no link
between a block and the simple module it belongs to, so the size of that block cannot be read off
it afterwards.  `TauCeti.exists_ringEquiv_pi_matrix_end_mulOpposite_blockMultiplicity` repeats that
construction over the isotypic components of the regular module and keeps the link, which is what
identifies each size with the corresponding block multiplicity and shows the simple modules
indexing the blocks to be pairwise non-isomorphic and exhaustive up to isomorphism.

## Implementation notes

`blockDivisionRing` and `blockMultiplicity` are defined for an arbitrary module `S`, exactly as
Mathlib defines `isotypicComponent` itself, and simplicity is an assumption of the lemmas that need
it rather than of the definitions.  Gating the definitions on `[IsSimpleModule R S]` would make
the intrinsic-data presentation unstatable: the simplicity of the modules
`TauCeti.exists_ringEquiv_pi_matrix_end_mulOpposite_blockMultiplicity` produces is part of its own
existential, so it is not available as an instance where the statement names their multiplicities.

`blockMultiplicity` takes `ENat.toNat` of a length, so it reads `0` on a module whose isotypic
component has infinite length; over a semisimple ring, where the regular module has finite length,
that never happens and `TauCeti.blockMultiplicity_pos` records the positivity.

Multiplicities are measured here by a length, not by a hom-space dimension as in
`TauCeti/RingTheory/Semisimple/Multiplicity.lean`: that file computes the multiplicity of a simple
module in an arbitrary module of a finite-dimensional algebra over an algebraically closed field,
where Schur's lemma makes `finrank k (S →ₗ[A] M)` the count, while a Wedderburn block is indexed by
a simple module over a bare semisimple ring, with a division ring of endomorphisms that need not be
the base field.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.blockDivisionRing`: the opposite endomorphism ring of a simple module.
* `TauCeti.blockMultiplicity`: the multiplicity of a simple module in the regular module.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.blockMultiplicity_eq_of_linearEquiv_fun`: a decomposition of the isotypic component as a
  power of `S` has exactly `blockMultiplicity R S` factors.
* `TauCeti.exists_ringEquiv_pi_matrix_end_mulOpposite_blockMultiplicity`:
  **a Wedderburn presentation realizing the intrinsic block data**, whose blocks are indexed by
  pairwise non-isomorphic simple left ideals, with the size of a block the multiplicity of its
  module and its coefficient ring the block division ring of that module.
* `TauCeti.WedderburnPresentation.exists_equiv_degree_eq_blockMultiplicity`: **the data of any
  Wedderburn presentation are the intrinsic data.**  After one permutation of its blocks, its
  degrees are the block multiplicities of pairwise non-isomorphic simple left ideals and its
  division rings are their block division rings, so its blocks match the isomorphism classes of
  simple modules one for one.

/-- **The block division ring of a simple module `S`**: the opposite `(Module.End R S)ᵐᵒᵖ` of its
endomorphism ring, which is a division ring by Schur's lemma.  It is the coefficient ring of the
Wedderburn block of `S`.

This is reducible, so it carries the instances of `(Module.End R S)ᵐᵒᵖ` unchanged, in particular
the `DivisionRing` structure Schur's lemma puts on that ring for simple `S`, and statements spelled
with either type are interchangeable. -/

/-- **The block multiplicity of a simple module `S`**: the number of copies of `S` in the regular
module of `R`, defined as the length of the `S`-isotypic component of `R`.

Over a semisimple ring the isotypic component is a finite direct sum of copies of `S`, so this is
the number of summands; taking the length instead makes the definition independent of a chosen
decomposition.  It is the size of the Wedderburn block of `S`. -/

/-- **A Wedderburn presentation realizing the intrinsic block data of a semisimple ring.**  The
blocks are indexed by pairwise non-isomorphic simple left ideals `S i` which exhaust all simple
modules up to isomorphism; the coefficient ring of a block is the block division ring
`blockDivisionRing R (S i)`, and its size is the multiplicity of `S i` in the regular module.

Mathlib's `IsSemisimpleRing.exists_ringEquiv_pi_matrix_end_mulOpposite` produces the same shape but
forgets which block belongs to which simple module, so neither the identification of the sizes with
the multiplicities nor the non-isomorphy of the `S i` can be recovered from it; the construction is
repeated here over the isotypic components of the regular module, where both are visible. -/
