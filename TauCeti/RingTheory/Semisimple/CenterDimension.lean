# The center bounds the number of simple modules of a semisimple algebra

A semisimple ring `R` has finitely many isomorphism classes of simple modules, indexed by the
isotypic components of the regular module (`TauCeti.simpleSubmoduleClassesEquiv`). When `R` is an
algebra over a field `k` with finite-dimensional center, this file bounds that number by the
dimension of the center:

`Nat.card (isotypicComponents R R) ≤ Module.finrank k (Subalgebra.center k R)`.

The bound is the counting half of Artin-Wedderburn, obtained without choosing a presentation
`R ≃+* ∏ᵢ Matₙᵢ(Dᵢ)`: for such a product the center is `∏ᵢ Z(Dᵢ)`, of dimension at least the number
of blocks, and the argument here says exactly that intrinsically. Where
`RingEquiv.card_blocks_eq` compares two presentations, this bound mentions none.

The mechanism is that each isotypic component of the regular module contains a nonzero *central*
element (`TauCeti.exists_ne_zero_mem_center_of_mem_isotypicComponents`). Writing `1 = ∑_c e_c` along
the decomposition of `R` into its isotypic components, the summand `e_c` is central because for
`z : R` the two decompositions `z = ∑_c z * e_c` and `z = ∑_c e_c * z` have their `c`-th terms in
the same summand: the first because `c` is a left ideal, the second because an isotypic component of
the regular module is *two-sided* (`TauCeti.isTwoSided_of_mem_isotypicComponents`, Mathlib's
`isFullyInvariant_iff_isTwoSided` read on `isotypicComponents R R`). It is nonzero because the same
uniqueness gives `x * e_c = x` for `x ∈ c`. Elements chosen one from each summand of an independent
family are linearly independent, so the components are at most as many as the dimension of the
center.

Nothing here needs `R` itself to be finite-dimensional: only the center is assumed finite as a
`k`-module, which is what a group algebra supplies through its class-sum basis. The central-element
construction works over any commutative semiring of scalars.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.isTwoSided_of_mem_isotypicComponents`: an isotypic component of the regular module is a
  two-sided ideal.
* `TauCeti.exists_ne_zero_mem_center_of_mem_isotypicComponents`: it contains a nonzero central
  element.
* `TauCeti.card_isotypicComponents_le_finrank_center`: the number of isotypic components of the
  regular module is at most the dimension of the center.
