# Invariance of the number of matrix blocks

Artin--Wedderburn presents a semisimple ring `R` as a finite product of positive-size matrix
algebras over division rings. `RingEquiv.card_blocks_eq` compares any two such presentations:
the number of blocks is an invariant of the ring.

Simplicity of the coefficient rings is all the argument uses. Positivity of the matrix sizes is
essential: a zero-size matrix algebra is trivial, so any presentation could be padded with such
blocks. These are the same `NeZero` hypotheses produced by
`IsSemisimpleRing.exists_ringEquiv_pi_matrix_divisionRing`. Semisimplicity of `R` guarantees a
Wedderburn presentation exists, but is not needed to compare presentations.

The underlying factor matching and cardinality invariance for arbitrary products of simple rings
are `RingEquiv.exists_equiv_factors` and `RingEquiv.card_eq_of_pi_of_isSimpleRing` in
`TauCeti/RingTheory/SimpleRing/Pi.lean`. The finer uniqueness of the matrix sizes and division
rings is `RingEquiv.wedderburn_blocks_unique` in
`TauCeti/RingTheory/Semisimple/Wedderburn/Uniqueness.lean`, which applies
`TauCeti.nonempty_ringEquiv_matrix_iff` to the matched matrix blocks.

## Main results

* `RingEquiv.card_blocks_eq`: two presentations as finite products of positive-size matrix
  algebras over simple rings have the same number of blocks.

/-- **Invariance of the block count.** Two presentations of the same ring as finite products of
positive-size matrix algebras over simple rings have the same number of blocks.

This applies in particular to two Wedderburn presentations. The `NeZero` hypotheses are essential:
a zero-size matrix algebra is trivial, so any presentation could be padded with empty blocks.
Semisimplicity of `R` guarantees a Wedderburn presentation exists, but is not needed here. -/
