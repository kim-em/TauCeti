# The endomorphism algebra of a module over a simple Artinian algebra

Let `K` be a field, let `R` be a finite-dimensional **simple** `K`-algebra and let `M` be an
`R`-module which is finite-dimensional over `K`. All simple `R`-modules are isomorphic, to a fixed
minimal left ideal `S`, and `M` is a direct sum of `k` copies of `S`
(`TauCeti.IsIsotypicOfType.of_isSimpleRing`), so

  `End_R M ≃ₐ[K] Mat_k(End_R S)`,

a matrix algebra over the division algebra `End_R S` supplied by Schur's lemma. Two consequences
are recorded here: `End_R M` is again a simple ring when `M ≠ 0`, and its dimension satisfies

  `finrank K (End_R M) * finrank K R = (finrank K M)²`.

Only the dimension identity needs the field: simplicity of `End_R M` is stated with no `K` in sight,
for a nonzero module `M` finite over a simple Artinian ring `R`.

The dimension identity is what makes `End_R M` computable without naming `S`, `k` or the division
algebra: writing `finrank K S = s`, `finrank K M = k * s` and `finrank K R = m * s`, the matrix
presentation gives `finrank K (End_R M) = k² * d` and `finrank K (End_R R) = m² * d` for
`d = finrank K (End_R S)`. Since `End_R R` is `R` itself, the second identity reads `m * s = m² * d`
and pins `s = m * d`; substituting turns the first into the displayed formula, in which `S`, `k`,
`m` and `d` have all disappeared.

Applied to `R = B ⊗[K] Aᵐᵒᵖ` acting on a simple algebra `A` containing a central simple subalgebra
`B`, whose endomorphism algebra is the centralizer of `B`, this is the engine of the centralizer
theorem in `TauCeti/Algebra/CentralSimple/Centralizer/Basic.lean`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.IsSimpleRing.finrank_end_mul_finrank_eq_sq`: the dimension identity
  `finrank K (End_R M) * finrank K R = (finrank K M)²`.
* `TauCeti.IsSimpleRing.moduleEnd`: `End_R M` is a simple ring, for `M` a nonzero module finite
  over a simple Artinian ring `R`.

## Implementation notes

The simple module `S` that both `M` and the regular module `R` are compared against is taken to be
a minimal left ideal of `R`, exactly as in `TauCeti/RingTheory/Semisimple/SimpleArtinian.lean`:
taking it inside `R` is what lets the same `S` serve both, which is what makes the two matrix
presentations comparable and lets `d = finrank K (End_R S)` cancel.

Simplicity of `R` is not weakened to semisimplicity. Over a semisimple ring with several blocks
`End_R M` is a *product* of matrix algebras, hence simple only when `M` is isotypic, and the
dimension identity fails: for `R = K × K` and `M = K × 0`, `End_R M` is `K`, so the left-hand side
is `1 * 2 = 2` while `(finrank K M)² = 1`.

/-- **The endomorphism ring of a nonzero finite module over a simple Artinian ring is simple.** It
is the matrix ring `Mat_k(End_R S)` over the division ring of Schur's lemma, with `k ≠ 0` because
`M ≠ 0`.

No base field is involved: `M` is a power `Sᵏ` of a minimal left ideal `S` of `R` because `R` is
simple Artinian and `M` is finite over `R`.  That is the only use made of simplicity of `R`, so
this is the specialization of `TauCeti.isSimpleRing_moduleEnd_of_isIsotypic` along
`IsSimpleRing.isIsotypic`. -/

/-- **The dimension of the endomorphism algebra of a module over a simple Artinian algebra.** For a
finite-dimensional simple `K`-algebra `R` and an `R`-module `M` finite-dimensional over `K`,

  `finrank K (End_R M) * finrank K R = (finrank K M)²`.

Both sides are `k² * m² * d²` in the notation of the module docstring: `M` is `Sᵏ` and `R` is `Sᵐ`
for a minimal left ideal `S` with `finrank K S = m * d`, where `d = finrank K (End_R S)`.

The identity determines `finrank K (End_R M)` outright, since `finrank K R ≠ 0`; it is stated as a
product rather than a quotient to stay inside `ℕ`. -/
