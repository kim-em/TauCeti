# Measures on a finite partial order are determined by their upper sets

Mathlib's `MeasureTheory.Measure.ext_of_Ici` says that a finite Borel measure on a second-countable
linear order is determined by its values on the closed upper rays `Set.Ici a`. On a *finite*
partial order no topology is needed, and neither is a total order: the ray `Set.Ici a` is the point
`a` together with the strictly larger points, so downward induction along the order recovers the
mass of every singleton from the masses of the rays, and a measure on a countable space with
measurable singletons is determined by its singletons.

The typical consumers are laws on finite lattices of finite graphs, where the mass of a ray is the
probability that a random graph contains a fixed pattern, and on products of such lattices.

## Main results

* `MeasureTheory.Measure.ext_of_Ici_of_finite` — two measures on a finite partial order with
  measurable singletons, the first of them finite, agree once they agree on every `Set.Ici a`.
