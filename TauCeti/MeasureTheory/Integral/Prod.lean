# Product-measure helpers

Small pieces of product-measure theory with no `L²` or inner-product content.

* `TauCeti.ae_of_ae_fst` / `TauCeti.ae_of_ae_snd` transfer an a.e. statement about one factor to the
  product measure, along `Measure.quasiMeasurePreserving_fst` / `_snd`.
* `TauCeti.exists_ae_eq_const_of_ae_prod_eq`: if `f x = g y` for almost every `(x, y)` in a product
  of nonzero measures, then `f` and `g` are almost everywhere the same constant. This is the
  uniqueness of a function of the form `f(x) + g(y)` up to one additive constant.
* `TauCeti.measurable_setLIntegral_of_measurableSet` proves measurability of a set integral whose
  truncating relation is jointly measurable.
* `TauCeti.lintegral_mul_setLIntegral_eq` exchanges a weighted integral of set integrals over an
  arbitrary parameter measure with the corresponding integral over the sections of the truncating
  relation.
* `TauCeti.lintegral_cond_prod_le` bounds a lower Lebesgue integral over a product of two
  conditional laws by any bound the integrand satisfies on the rectangle conditioned on. Use it to
  estimate an integral against two independently conditioned coordinates when the integrand is
  controlled only on the pair of sets being conditioned on.
* `TauCeti.setIntegral_eq_zero_of_forall_prod` is the binary-product specialization of the Dynkin
  (π-λ) step for Bochner integrals: a function whose integral vanishes on every measurable rectangle
  has vanishing integral on every measurable set. Rectangles are a π-system generating the product
  σ-algebra (`MeasureTheory.isPiSystem_prod`, `MeasureTheory.generateFrom_prod`), so this is the
  general `TauCeti.setIntegral_eq_zero_of_isPiSystem` instantiated at that π-system; the only work
  left here is extracting the whole-space hypothesis from the rectangle `univ ×ˢ univ`.

truncating relation `R` and a.e.-measurable integrand and weight, integrating first in `x` and then
against the parameter measure gives the same value as integrating the weight over each parameter
section and then in `x`. -/
