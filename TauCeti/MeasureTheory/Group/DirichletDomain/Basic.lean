# Dirichlet domains

Let a group `G` act by isometries on a metric space `X`, and fix a centre `p : X`. The
**Dirichlet domain** of `p` is the set of points at least as close to `p` as to every other point
of its orbit,
`{x | ∀ g : G, dist x p ≤ dist x (g • p)}`.

For a properly discontinuous action on a proper space, every orbit meets the Dirichlet domain:
the orbit of `p` has only finitely many points in each closed ball, so the distance from a point
to the orbit of `p` is attained. If two translates of the Dirichlet domain meet, every common
point is equidistant from the two corresponding translates of `p`. Consequently, when the centre
has trivial stabilizer and the equidistant set of any two distinct orbit points is null, the
Dirichlet domain is a measurable fundamental domain. In the hyperbolic plane these equidistant
sets are geodesics, which is how the Dirichlet polygon of a Fuchsian group arises.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.dirichletDomain G p`: the Dirichlet domain of the centre `p`.
* `TauCeti.isClosed_dirichletDomain`: it is closed.
* `TauCeti.smul_dirichletDomain`: translating the Dirichlet domain translates its centre.
* `TauCeti.finite_dirichletCompetitors`: on a bounded set, only finitely many acting elements can
  move the centre to a point at least as close as the centre.
* `TauCeti.exists_finset_dirichletDomain_inter_eq`: on a bounded set, the Dirichlet domain is
  cut out by finitely many of its defining inequalities.
* `TauCeti.mem_interior_dirichletDomain_of_forall_dist_lt`: strict dominance over distinct orbit
  points implies interior membership.
* `TauCeti.exists_smul_mem_dirichletDomain`: for a properly discontinuous isometric action on a
  proper space, every orbit meets it.
* `TauCeti.dirichletDomain_inter_dirichletDomain_smul_subset`: the Dirichlet domains of two
  points of one orbit meet only in points equidistant from them.
* `TauCeti.isFundamentalDomain_dirichletDomain`: it is a fundamental domain when the centre has
  trivial stabilizer and equidistant sets of distinct orbit points are null.

/-- **A Dirichlet domain has finitely many defining inequalities on every bounded set.**
For a bounded `K`, there is a finite set `s` of acting elements such that intersecting `K` with
the full Dirichlet domain is the same as imposing only the inequalities indexed by `s` on `K`.
This is the local-finiteness input for viewing Dirichlet domains as locally finite intersections
of the distance-dominance regions `{x | dist x p ≤ dist x (g • p)}`. -/
