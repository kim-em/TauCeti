# The metric derivative of a curve

For a curve `γ : ℝ → X` in an extended pseudometric space, the *metric derivative* at `t` is
`|γ'|(t) = limsup_{s → t, s ≠ t} edist (γ s) (γ t) / |s - t|`, the metric replacement for the norm
of the velocity of a curve in a normed space (`HasDerivAt.metricDerivative_eq`). It is the speed
that the action `∫ |γ'|(t)ᵖ dt` of a curve integrates, and so the basic object behind absolutely
continuous curves in metric spaces, dynamic transport plans and metric gradient flows.

The main result is the *fundamental theorem for absolutely continuous metric-valued curves*
(Ambrosio–Gigli–Savaré, Theorem 1.1.2). For a curve `γ` that is absolutely continuous on `[a, b]`
in Mathlib's sense, `AbsolutelyContinuousOnInterval γ a b`:

* the difference quotients `edist (γ s) (γ t) / edist s t` converge, so the `limsup` defining the
  metric derivative is a genuine limit, at almost every `t ∈ [a, b]`;
* the metric derivative has finite integral over `[a, b]`, and
  `edist (γ s) (γ u) ≤ ∫⁻ r in Ι s u, |γ'|(r)` for all `s, u ∈ [a, b]`;
* it is the smallest such density: any almost everywhere measurable `m` with finite integral over
  `[a, b]` satisfying the same bound dominates the metric derivative almost everywhere on `[a, b]`.

Conversely a curve admitting such an integrable density is absolutely continuous, so absolute
continuity of a metric-valued curve is exactly the existence of an integrable density bounding its
distances, which is the definition used by Ambrosio–Gigli–Savaré
(`absolutelyContinuousOnInterval_iff_exists_edist_le_lintegral`).

The proof of the fundamental theorem follows Ambrosio–Gigli–Savaré. The image of `[a, b]` is
compact, hence separable, so it has a countable dense subset `c`. Each distance profile
`r ↦ dist (γ r) x` with `x ∈ c` is a real absolutely continuous function, hence the integral of its
derivative, and the supremum `m` of the absolute values of these derivatives bounds
`edist (γ s) (γ u)` by `∫⁻ r in Ι s u, m r`. Every difference quotient of `γ` dominates those of
the profiles, so `m` is a lower bound for the `liminf`, while the Lebesgue differentiation theorem
makes `m` an upper bound for the `limsup`. Finiteness of `∫⁻ m` comes from the variation function
of `γ`, a monotone real function whose increments dominate the distances along `γ`, so that its
integrable derivative bounds the metric derivative almost everywhere.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.metricDerivative γ t`: the metric derivative of `γ` at `t`, as an extended nonnegative
  real.

## Main results

* `HasDerivAt.tendsto_edist_div` and `HasDerivAt.metricDerivative_eq`: on a normed space the
  difference quotients converge to the norm of the derivative, which is the metric derivative.
* `TauCeti.continuousAt_of_metricDerivative_ne_top`: a curve is continuous wherever its metric
  derivative is finite.
* `LipschitzWith.metricDerivative_le` and `LipschitzWith.metricDerivative_comp_le`: Lipschitz
  bounds on a curve and under Lipschitz post-composition.
* `BoundedVariationOn.ae_metricDerivative_le_enorm_deriv_variationOnFromTo`: for a curve of bounded
  variation, the metric derivative is almost everywhere at most the derivative of the variation.
* `TauCeti.ae_metricDerivative_le`: minimality of the metric derivative among the integrable
  densities bounding the distances along a curve.
* `AbsolutelyContinuousOnInterval.ae_tendsto_metricDerivative`,
  `AbsolutelyContinuousOnInterval.lintegral_metricDerivative_lt_top` and
  `AbsolutelyContinuousOnInterval.edist_le_lintegral_metricDerivative`: the fundamental theorem
  for absolutely continuous curves.
* `TauCeti.absolutelyContinuousOnInterval_iff_exists_edist_le_lintegral`: absolute continuity as
  the existence of an integrable density bounding the distances along a curve.

/-- **Absolute continuity of a metric-valued curve** is the existence of an integrable density
bounding its distances: `γ` is absolutely continuous on `[a, b]` exactly when some `m` with finite
integral over `[a, b]` bounds `edist (γ s) (γ u)` by `∫⁻ r in Ι s u, m r` for all `s, u ∈ [a, b]`.
The metric derivative is such an `m`, and by `TauCeti.ae_metricDerivative_le` it is almost
everywhere below every almost everywhere measurable one. -/
