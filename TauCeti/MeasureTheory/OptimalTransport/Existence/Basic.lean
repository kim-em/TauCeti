# Existence of an optimal transport plan

The primal Kantorovich problem minimises `π ↦ ∫⁻ z, c z ∂π` over the couplings of two fixed
probability measures. This file proves that the minimum is attained for a lower semicontinuous
cost: the infimum defining `TauCeti.transportCost` is a minimum, realised by a plan satisfying
`TauCeti.IsOptimalCoupling`.

The proof is the direct method of the calculus of variations, with both of its ingredients already
isolated. The feasible set is weakly compact and nonempty
(`TauCeti.isCompact_setOfPred_isCoupling`, the product plan), and the objective is weakly lower
semicontinuous (`TauCeti.lowerSemicontinuous_lintegral_probabilityMeasure`); a lower semicontinuous
function on a nonempty compact set attains its infimum.

Nothing here needs the minimum to be finite. If every plan has infinite cost — which happens, for
instance, when `c` is `∞` off the diagonal and the two marginals are mutually singular — the
theorem still produces an optimal plan, of cost `∞`; the statement separates existence from
finiteness, as the roadmap asks.

The cost is only assumed lower semicontinuous, not continuous, and this is the point: the costs of
interest, such as `edist` raised to a power or the `{0, ∞}`-valued indicator of a closed constraint
set, are lower semicontinuous, and lower semicontinuity is exactly what guarantees attainment of
the infimum on the compact set of couplings.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.exists_isOptimalCoupling_of_isTightMeasureSet` — an optimal plan exists whenever both
  marginals are tight;
* `TauCeti.exists_isOptimalCoupling` — its Polish specialisation, where tightness is automatic;
* `TauCeti.exists_coupling_isOptimalCoupling` — the same statement with the plan delivered as an
  element of the bundled type `TauCeti.Coupling`;
* `TauCeti.isCompact_setOfPred_isOptimalCoupling` — the optimal plans themselves form a weakly
  compact set;
* `TauCeti.transportCost_iSup_eq_iSup` — minimization over a compact coupling set supplied by
  tight marginals commutes with an increasing supremum of lower-semicontinuous costs;
* `TauCeti.transportCost_eq_iSup_transportCost_lscApprox` — transport cost commutes with the
  canonical monotone approximation of a lower-semicontinuous cost;
* `TauCeti.exists_isOptimalCoupling_edist` and `TauCeti.exists_isOptimalCoupling_edist_rpow` — the
  acceptance instances: the Kantorovich–Rubinstein cost `edist`, and the `p`-Wasserstein cost
  `edist ^ p`, admit optimal plans on a Polish space.

under which the product is a Borel space and the coupling set is weakly compact. Metrizability is
asked of the topology, not of a chosen distance, so a space known only to be Polish qualifies; the
pseudometric that the direct method runs on is installed inside the proofs. -/

the transport cost, the reverse inequality being automatic; so the optimal set is the intersection
of the compact set of couplings with a weakly closed sublevel set of the cost functional. Together
with `TauCeti.exists_isOptimalCoupling_of_isTightMeasureSet`, which makes it nonempty, this is the
compactness a selection argument runs on. -/

/-- **Monotone convergence of optimal transport costs for tight marginals.** The transport cost
of the pointwise supremum of an increasing sequence of lower-semicontinuous costs is the supremum
of their transport costs. No finiteness assumption is made: both sides may be `∞`.

Tightness is load-bearing because it makes the fixed-marginal coupling set compact. Without
compactness, an escaping sequence of approximate minimizers can make the supremum of the minima
strictly smaller than the minimum of the supremum. -/
