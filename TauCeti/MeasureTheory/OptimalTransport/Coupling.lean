# Couplings of two measures

A *coupling*, or *transport plan*, of a measure `μ` on `X` and a measure `ν` on `Y` is a measure
`π` on `X × Y` whose two marginals are `μ` and `ν`. It is the primitive object of optimal
transport: the primal transport problem minimises a cost over the couplings of two fixed
measures, so every statement about that problem is a statement about the set defined here.

Nothing in this file needs a topology, a metric, a density, or a normalisation, and the two
factors may be different measurable spaces. The relation is therefore stated for arbitrary
measures, and the probability case is packaged separately as a subtype of
`MeasureTheory.ProbabilityMeasure (X × Y)`.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.IsCoupling π μ ν` — the plan-first coupling relation: `π.fst = μ` and
  `π.snd = ν`;
* `TauCeti.Coupling μ ν` — couplings of two probability measures, bundled as a subtype of
  `MeasureTheory.ProbabilityMeasure (X × Y)`;
* `TauCeti.Coupling.prod` — the independent coupling, and with it
  `TauCeti.Coupling.instNonempty`.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.IsCoupling.measure_prod_univ` and `TauCeti.IsCoupling.measure_univ_prod` — the
  marginal formulas on measurable cylinders, with the converse
  `TauCeti.isCoupling_of_measure_prod_univ_of_measure_univ_prod`;
* `TauCeti.IsCoupling.measurePreserving_fst`, `TauCeti.IsCoupling.measurePreserving_snd`,
  `TauCeti.IsCoupling.integral_comp_fst`, and `TauCeti.IsCoupling.integral_comp_snd` — projection
  and integral-transfer forms of the marginal conditions;
* `TauCeti.IsCoupling.prodProdProdComm` — exchanging the two middle coordinates of a product of
  two couplings couples the two product measures;
* `TauCeti.exists_isCoupling_iff` — a finite measure and any other measure admit a coupling
  exactly when they have the same total mass, the witness being their normalised product;
* `TauCeti.isCoupling_map_swap_iff` and `TauCeti.isCoupling_map_prodMap_iff` —
  invariance of the relation under the coordinate swap and under measurable equivalences of the
  two factors;
* `TauCeti.isCoupling_toMeasure_iff` — the coupling condition on bundled probability measures,
  as the pair of equations for the two marginal pushforwards;
* `TauCeti.IsCoupling.eq_map_prodMk` — a coupling out of a Dirac measure is the
  pushforward of its target along `y ↦ (x, y)`, so it is unique; `IsCoupling.eq_dirac`
  specialises this to a pair of Dirac measures.

## Implementation notes

The argument order `IsCoupling π μ ν` takes the plan first, so that a hypothesis
`hπ : IsCoupling π μ ν` supports dot notation such as `hπ.swap` and `hπ.map`. This convention,
and the choice to state the relation for raw measures rather than only for bundled probability
measures, follow Joseph K. Miller's Apache-2.0 `Vlasov.IsCoupling`
(<https://github.com/Hydrodynamical/Vlasov_Meanfield_Formalization>), the closest existing Lean
development of the same relation; no code is taken from it. The bundled subtype mirrors
`TauCeti.MultiCoupling`, the multi-marginal analogue already in this repository.

The declarations sit in the bare `TauCeti` namespace rather than in `TauCeti.Measure`:
`scripts/lint-dot-notation.py` rejects a new declaration under `TauCeti.<Mathlib type
namespace>` that takes an explicit argument of that type, because `π.IsCoupling μ ν` would not
elaborate there anyway. Dot notation on `hπ` works under either namespace; the bare namespace is
forced by the lint rule and matches `TauCeti.MultiCoupling`.

This is Layer 0, item 1 of the optimal-transport roadmap.

  measure-preserving projection and integral-transfer declarations and proofs adapted here to the
  plan-first `TauCeti.IsCoupling` interface.

  probability measures. `TauCeti.IsCoupling` states it for arbitrary measures, so the
  probability case is the bundled `TauCeti.Coupling`.
