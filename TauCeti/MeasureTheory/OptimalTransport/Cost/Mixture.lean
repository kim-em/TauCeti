# Transport costs of mixtures

For a fixed cost `c`, the transport cost is positively homogeneous and countably subadditive as a
function of the pair of marginals:

`transportCost c (a • μ) (a • ν) = a * transportCost c μ ν` and
`transportCost c (∑ i, μ i) (∑ i, ν i) ≤ ∑ i, transportCost c (μ i) (ν i)`.

Together they say that the transport cost of a mixture `(∑ i, a i • μ i, ∑ i, a i • ν i)` is at
most the corresponding mixture of the transport costs — the convexity of optimal transport in the
two marginals. The reason is that couplings can be mixed: the sum of couplings of the pairs
`(μ i, ν i)` couples the two sums (`TauCeti.IsCoupling.sum`), and the cost of a plan is additive
in the plan.

No finiteness or normalisation is assumed of the measures, and the cost need not be measurable.
Subadditivity cannot in general be improved to an equality: splitting `δ_x + δ_y` against itself
as `(δ_x, δ_y) + (δ_y, δ_x)` with the cost `edist` gives a strict inequality whenever `x ≠ y`.
Homogeneity is stated for a finite scaling factor. By homogeneity, two optimal plans for the same
pair of marginals add up to an optimal plan for the doubled marginals; uniqueness theorems for
optimal plans compare two optimal plans through their sum.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.transportCost_smul` — scaling both marginals by a finite factor scales the transport
  cost;
* `TauCeti.transportCost_sum_le` — countable subadditivity for `MeasureTheory.Measure.sum`;
* `TauCeti.transportCost_finset_sum_le` and `TauCeti.transportCost_add_le` — the finite and binary
  forms of subadditivity;
* `TauCeti.IsOptimalCoupling.add` — the sum of two optimal plans for the same marginals is optimal
  for the doubled marginals.
