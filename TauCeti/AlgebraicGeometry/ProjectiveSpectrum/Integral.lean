# Reducedness and integrality of `Proj`

For an `ℕ`-graded ring `A`, this file shows that `Proj A` is a reduced scheme when `A` is a reduced
ring, and that it is an integral scheme when `A` is an integral domain whose irrelevant ideal is
nonzero, that is, when `A` has a nonzero homogeneous element of positive degree.

## Main results

* `AlgebraicGeometry.Proj.isReduced`: `Proj A` is reduced if `A` is reduced.
* `AlgebraicGeometry.Proj.isIntegral_of_isDomain`: `Proj A` is integral if `A` is a domain with
  nonzero irrelevant ideal.

## References

* Stacks Project, Tag 01M3 (Proj of a graded ring).

## Provenance

Adapted from AINTLIB (`github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB`, Apache-2.0) at commit
`c3415f32a313e19ace43e05479aeaa0d56ca287a`, file
`projects/ModularCurves/ModularCurves/ForMathlib/ProjIntegral.lean`, declaration
`AlgebraicGeometry.Proj.isIntegral_of_isDomain`. Here reducedness is a separate instance for `Proj`
of any reduced graded ring rather than of a domain, and the positivity hypothesis is phrased as
the nonvanishing of the irrelevant ideal.
