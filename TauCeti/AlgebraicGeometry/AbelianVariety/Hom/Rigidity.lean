# Morphisms of abelian varieties preserving the identity are homomorphisms

A morphism `f : A.toOver ⟶ B.toOver` of the underlying schemes over `Spec K` that sends the
identity of `A` to the identity of `B` is automatically a homomorphism of group schemes. The
defect `h (x, y) = f (x + y) - f x - f y` is a morphism
`A.toOver ⊗ A.toOver ⟶ B.toOver` that vanishes on `A × {0}`,
so by `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.eq_snd_comp_lift_comp` it depends only on `y`, and it
vanishes on `{0} × A`.

Consequently the homomorphisms `A ⟶ B` of abelian varieties are exactly the pointed morphisms
`A.toOver ⟶ B.toOver` over `Spec K`. This is how morphisms of abelian varieties arise in
practice, for instance from the universal property of the Jacobian, where a morphism of schemes
is produced first and only then recognised as a homomorphism.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.isMonHom_of_one_hom`: a morphism from a monoid scheme to a group
  scheme preserving the identity is a homomorphism when the source is proper and geometrically
  integral;
* `TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.AbelianVariety.Hom.equivPointed`: homomorphisms `A ⟶ B` are
  equivalent to the morphisms `A.toOver ⟶ B.toOver` preserving the identity.
