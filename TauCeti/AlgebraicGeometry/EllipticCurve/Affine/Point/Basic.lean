# Coordinates and constructor elimination for affine points

`WeierstrassCurve.Affine.Point` is a two-constructor inductive type: the point at infinity, and an
affine point together with a nonsingularity certificate. Ruling out the first constructor and
naming the data of the second is a step that recurs wherever a point is known to be nonzero.
This file also supplies total coordinate accessors, junk-valued at the point at infinity, so
downstream definitions can read both coordinates without embedding a case split.

The existential form reads best when the point is a compound term such as `n • P`: `obtain` names
the coordinates, the nonsingularity certificate and the identifying equation in one line, with no
separate generalisation to arrange. The accessor form is useful when the coordinates must occur in
a definition, such as evaluation at a translated generic point.

Most coordinate reconstruction results assume the point is nonzero. The descent criterion
`exists_map_eq_iff` handles infinity separately: both accessors are `0` there, and infinity
descends along every field embedding. Nothing here needs ellipticity. The map lemmas need field
hypotheses only because Mathlib's `Point.map` does.

## Main definitions

* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.Point.xCoord` and
  `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.Point.yCoord`: the two affine coordinates, both `0` at infinity.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.Point.exists_eq_some_of_ne_zero`: a nonzero affine point is `.some`,
  in a form that applies to a compound point.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.Point.nonsingular_coords` and
  `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.Point.some_coords`: a nonzero point is `.some` of its accessors.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.Point.eq_of_coords`: nonzero points with equal coordinates are equal.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.Point.xCoord_map` and
  `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.Point.yCoord_map`: the accessors commute with `Point.map`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.Point.exists_map_eq_iff`: a point descends along a field embedding
  exactly when both coordinates do.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.Point.cast_zero` and `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.Point.cast_some`:
  transport along an equality of curves, as in `AddEquiv.cast` and `Equiv.cast`, fixes the
  point at infinity and keeps the coordinates of a point.

The coordinate accessors support `TauCetiRoadmap/EllipticCurves/README.md`, Layer 0.5, whose
translation-action milestone evaluates functions at translates of the generic point.

## Provenance

Not a port: Mathlib carries `Point.xRep`, the projective representative of the `x`-coordinate
map to `ℙ¹`, but that object intentionally identifies `±P` and records no `y`-coordinate.
