# Integral points of a Weierstrass curve over a valued field

Let `F` be a field, let `v` be a valuation on `F`, let `O` be the valuation subring of `v`, and
let `W` be a Weierstrass curve over `F` admitting a model over `O`. This file records the
valuation estimates that such a model forces, and the dichotomy they produce for the coordinates
of an affine point.

The dichotomy is the sharp one: `v(x)` is never `exp 1`. Either the point is integral,
`v(x) ≤ 1` and `v(y) ≤ 1`, or it is a pole of order at least two in `x`, `exp 2 ≤ v(x)`. There is
nothing in between: at a pole `v(y)² = v(x)³`, and `exp 3` is not a square, which rules out the
one intermediate value. Only pole order one is excluded here — the general statement that every
pole order is even is not proved.

The two halves need different hypotheses, and are stated that way. The coefficient bounds — and
the estimates on the two sides of the Weierstrass equation — never look at the value group, so
they are stated for an arbitrary `Γ₀`. Only the dichotomy needs `Γ₀ = ℤᵐ⁰`, because the parity
argument that rules out `v(x) = exp 1` is about the exponent being an integer.

The valuation is taken as an explicit argument rather than through `Valued F Γ₀`. Nothing here
uses a topology, and a fixed field carries many valuations at once — the intended consumers are
the `IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum.valuation` of a varying prime, which cannot all be
`Valued` instances on `F` simultaneously.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.valuation_a₁_le_one` and its `a₂`, `a₃`, `a₄`, `a₆` companions: the
  coefficients of a curve with an integral model are integral, over any value group.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.valuation_x_lt_valuation_y`: at a pole of `x`, the `y`-coordinate
  strictly dominates.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.valuation_y_sq_eq_valuation_x_cube`: at a pole of `x`, the two
  coordinates have poles in ratio two to three, over any value group.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.valuation_y_le_one_of_valuation_x_le_one`: an integral `x`-coordinate
  forces an integral `y`-coordinate, over any value group.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.valuation_x_le_one_and_valuation_y_le_one_of_valuation_x_lt_exp_two`:
  an affine point whose `x`-coordinate has a pole of order less than two has both coordinates
  integral.

## Implementation notes

The hypothesis "`W` has a model over `O`" is Mathlib's `WeierstrassCurve.IsIntegral O W`, and the
model itself is `WeierstrassCurve.integralModel O W`; the coefficient bounds are then Mathlib's
`WeierstrassCurve.integralModel_aᵢ_eq` composed with membership in `O`.

The `y`-half of the dichotomy is not reproved by a valuation computation. Once `x` is known to be
integral, `WeierstrassCurve.isIntegral_y_of_equation_of_isIntegral_x` gives that `y` is
integral over `O` from the curve equation alone, over any algebra and with no valuation in sight;
`O` is a valuation subring, hence integrally closed in `F`, so integrality over it is membership.
That is how the main theorem discharges its `y`-half. Only the `x`-half — the parity argument that
rules out `v(x) = exp 1` — is genuinely about the valuation, and it is the only half that needs
the estimates below.

The estimates distinguish integral points from points reducing to infinity. Over a complete
discretely valued field, they connect the formal group at infinity to the kernel of reduction.

## Provenance

Adapted from the Stoll `EllipticCurves` development
(`github.com/MichaelStollBayreuth/EllipticCurves`, Apache-2.0, at `66889eada51a`),
`EllipticCurves/WeierstrassFormalGroup/Foundations.lean`: `valued_a₁`–`valued_a₄` (:125–:128),
`valued_a₆` (:129), `valued_lhs_eq_rhs` (:72), `valued_rhs_eq` (:132), `valued_lhs_eq` (:164),
`valued_lhs_le` (:185), `valued_ne_exp_one` (:202) and `integral_of_not_mem` (:264), which is
`valuation_x_le_one_and_valuation_y_le_one_of_valuation_x_lt_exp_two` here.

The main departures are as follows. The source's private `coe_a₁`–`coe_a₆` (:110–:122) are not
ported: they restate
the structure map for a model carried in the signature, whereas the model here is Mathlib's
`integralModel`, so the five coefficient bounds are `integralModel_aᵢ_eq` plus membership in `O`.
The setting is more general: the source works over `v.adicCompletion K` and
`v.adicCompletionIntegers K`, whereas no step uses completeness, the Dedekind hypothesis, or a
topology, so the results are stated for a bare `(v : Valuation F Γ₀)` and its valuation subring —
a weaker hypothesis set that still covers the source's case, `adicCompletionIntegers` being by
definition the valuation subring of `Valued.v`. `valuation_a₆_le_one` is public here although the
source's `valued_a₆` (:129) is private: the five coefficient bounds are one API, and a consumer
holding an integral model needs all five. The hypothesis is stated positively as `v x < exp 2`
rather than the source's `¬ exp 2 ≤ v x`. And the `y`-half is proved by reuse rather than by the
source's valuation computation: the source derives it from a `valued_rhs_le` bound (:151), whereas
here `isIntegral_y_of_equation_of_isIntegral_x` plus integral closedness of `O` gives it directly,
so that bound has no consumer and is not ported.

/-! ### The coefficient bounds, over an arbitrary value group

Nothing in this section looks at the value group: an integral model bounds the coefficients, and
the two sides of the Weierstrass equation are estimated, for any `Γ₀`. Only the dichotomy below
needs `Γ₀ = ℤᵐ⁰`.

`Field F` remains necessary for the coefficient bounds because `Valuation.valuationSubring` is
defined only for a field. -/
