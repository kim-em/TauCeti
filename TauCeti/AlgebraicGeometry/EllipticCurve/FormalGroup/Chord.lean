# The chord through two points of a Weierstrass curve near the origin

The `w`-expansion of `WeierstrassCurve.formalW` lives in the coordinates `z = -x/y`, `w = -1/y`
obtained from the affine coordinates of `W` by `x = z / w`, `y = -1 / w`. In those coordinates
the point at infinity is the origin, and the curve is parametrised near it by `z ↦ (z, w(z))`,
where `w(z)` solves the transformed Weierstrass equation. The `(z, w)` here are therefore *not*
the affine coordinates of `W`; everything below happens in the transformed chart.

The substitution turns an affine line of `W` into a relation `w = λ z + ν`, so the chord through
the two parameters `z₁` and `z₂` is described by a slope and an intercept, as power series in
`R⟦z₁, z₂⟧` — variables indexed by `Unit ⊕ Unit`, as in Mathlib's formal-group-law conventions.
Substituting `w = λ z + ν` into the transformed equation leaves a cubic in `z`, whose three roots
are the parameters of the three points in which the chord meets the curve; the third of them is
`formalThirdRoot`.

Together these are the data of the chord construction: the formal group law of `W` is obtained
from `formalThirdRoot` by composing with the formal inverse, which is left to a later file.

## Main definitions

* `WeierstrassCurve.formalSlope`: the slope `λ(z₁, z₂) = (w(z₂) - w(z₁)) / (z₂ - z₁)` of the
  chord, defined through its coefficients rather than as a quotient.
* `WeierstrassCurve.formalIntercept`: the intercept `ν(z₁, z₂) = w(z₁) - λ(z₁, z₂) z₁`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.formalThirdRoot`: the parameter `z₃(z₁, z₂)` of the third point in which
  the chord meets the curve, obtained from Vieta's formulas.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.coeff_formalSlope`, `WeierstrassCurve.formalIntercept_def` and
  `WeierstrassCurve.formalThirdRoot_def`: the defining formulas, as named lemmas. Rewrite with
  these rather than unfolding the definitions.
* `WeierstrassCurve.formalSlope_mul_X_add`: the defining property
  `λ z₂ + w(z₁) = λ z₁ + w(z₂)` of the slope over a commutative semiring. Over a ring this
  becomes `λ · (z₂ - z₁) = w(z₂) - w(z₁)`, which justifies calling it a divided difference.
* `WeierstrassCurve.rename_swap_formalSlope`, `_formalIntercept`, `_formalThirdRoot`: all three
  series are invariant under exchanging the two parameters, so the chord depends on the two
  points and not on their order. This is what makes the eventual group law commutative.
* `WeierstrassCurve.formalIntercept_eq_inr`: the intercept computed from the second point.
* `WeierstrassCurve.constantCoeff_formalSlope`, `_formalIntercept`, `_formalThirdRoot`: all
  three series vanish at the origin.
* `WeierstrassCurve.subst_formalThirdRoot_formalW`: the third point really lies on the chord —
  reading the `w`-expansion at `formalThirdRoot` returns the chord line read there. This is what
  makes the third root the parameter of an intersection point rather than merely a root of the
  cubic.

## Implementation notes

`formalSlope` is defined by the coefficient formula rather than as a quotient of power series:
`z₂ - z₁` is not a unit in `R⟦z₁, z₂⟧`, so the divided difference has to be written down
directly and `formalSlope_mul_X_add` recovers the property that names it.

The slope, its defining relation and the constant coefficient of the third-root denominator
need no subtraction, so they are stated over a `CommSemiring`, matching `formalW`. The
intercept and third-root constructions use subtraction and are stated over a `CommRing`.

## Provenance

Adapted from Michael Stoll's `EllipticCurves` project
(`github.com/MichaelStollBayreuth/EllipticCurves`, Apache-2.0, revision `66889eada51a`),
`EllipticCurves/WeierstrassFormalGroup/Chord.lean`, its `Chord` section down to the third-root
series together with the swap-invariance block — declarations `slopeSeries`, `coeff_slopeSeries`,
`slopeSeries_mul_sub`, `interceptSeries`, `interceptSeries_eq`, `constantCoeff_slopeSeries`,
`constantCoeff_interceptSeries`, `thirdRootSeries`, `constantCoeff_thirdRootSeries`,
`rename_swap_slopeSeries`, `rename_swap_interceptSeries` and `rename_swap_thirdRootSeries`.
The source's `rename_swap_invOfUnit` is not ported: it is the general
`MvPowerSeries.map_invOfUnit` specialised to `rename Sum.swap`, and is used as such.

The source's `wSeries` and `vSeries` are `formalW` and `formalU`, so neither is re-ported and
everything here is stated over the existing `w`-expansion API. Where
the source writes `MvPowerSeries.rename (fun _ => i)`, this file uses the equal Mathlib map
`PowerSeries.toMvPowerSeries i`.

The on-line section is adapted from the same project's
`EllipticCurves/WeierstrassFormalGroup/GroupLaw.lean`, its `Domain` section — declarations
`line_at_thirdRoot` and `subst_thirdRootSeries_wSeries`. Four of that section's steps are not
ported. `X_inl_ne_X_inr` is not needed at all: the cancellation runs through
`MvPowerSeries.X_sub_X_mem_nonZeroDivisors`, which never separates the two variables. The other
three this repository already has — `line_left` and `line_right` are `formalIntercept_def` and
`formalIntercept_eq_inr` with the terms moved across the equals sign, and `wsAt_rename` is
`subst_formalW_wEquation` read through Mathlib's `PowerSeries.toMvPowerSeries_eq_subst`; all
three are inlined at their single use site. The source's `LowVanish` hypotheses have no counterpart
here at all, since `eq_of_wEquation_mvPowerSeries` takes vanishing constant coefficients
directly.

The source guards `line_at_thirdRoot` with `set_option maxRecDepth 4000 in`. That is not ported:
TauCeti's CI forbids `set_option` under `TauCeti/`, and the proof elaborates at the default
depth here, so the guard was never load-bearing for this statement.

`z₃ = -z₁ - z₂ - (a₁λ + a₂ν + a₃λ² + 2a₄λν + 3a₆λ²ν) / (1 + a₂λ + a₄λ² + a₆λ³)`,

/-! ### The third point lies on the chord

Vieta's formulas produce `formalThirdRoot` from the coefficients of the chord cubic, which by
itself says nothing about where the curve meets that chord: it is an identity between series, not
a statement that the point with parameter `z₃` lies on the line `w = λ z + ν`. It does, and the
argument is the classical one — the cubic already has `z₁` and `z₂` among its roots, so cancelling
`z₁ - z₂` from the difference of the two identities pins the third.

That cancellation needs no hypothesis on `R`. The difference of two distinct variables is a
non-zero-divisor of `MvPowerSeries (Unit ⊕ Unit) R` over an arbitrary commutative ring
(`MvPowerSeries.X_sub_X_mem_nonZeroDivisors`), because the coefficient recursion behind it never
cancels anything in `R`.
-/

/-- The chord line, read at the third root, satisfies the `w`-equation at that parameter.

This is Vieta's formula in the form the uniqueness of the `w`-expansion can consume: the third
root is characterised here by *solving the equation*, not by its coefficient formula. -/
