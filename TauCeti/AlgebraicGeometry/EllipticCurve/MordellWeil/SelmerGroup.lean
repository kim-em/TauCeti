# The 2-Selmer group, and the Mordell–Weil rank bound it gives

Explicit `2`-descent cuts the square classes `W.M` of the étale algebra down by two kinds of
condition: a global one, that the norm class is trivial (`WeierstrassCurve.Affine.normM`), and a
local one at each place (`WeierstrassCurve.Affine.localCondition`). The subgroup cut out by all
of them is the **2-Selmer group**, and the descent map `μ` lands inside it.

Its value is as an upper bound on the rank: `ker μ = 2 • W(K)`, so `im μ ≅ W(K)/2W(K)`, whose
order is `2 ^ rank W(K) * #W(K)[2]`. Any *finite* subgroup containing `im μ` therefore bounds the
rank, and that is `pow_rank_le_card_of_range_μ_le`, stated for an arbitrary finite `S` rather
than for the Selmer group itself.

Nothing here establishes that the Selmer group is finite, over the arbitrary Dedekind domain and
auxiliary fields used below or otherwise; that is a separate result, and so is any effective
computation of the resulting bound.

## Main definitions

* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.selmerGroup₂`: the 2-Selmer group of `W` relative to a Dedekind domain
  `R` with fraction field `K` and an auxiliary family `Loc` of `K`-fields — the square classes
  with trivial norm class satisfying the local condition at every finite place of `R` and at
  every member of `Loc`. For a number field this is the classical 2-Selmer group.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.range_μ_le_selmerGroup₂`: the image of the descent map lies in the
  2-Selmer group. With `ker_μ_eq` this embeds `W(K)/2W(K)` into it.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.card_range_μ`: `#(im μ) = 2 ^ rank W(K) * #W(K)[2]`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.pow_rank_le_card_of_range_μ_le`: **the rank bound**, that any finite
  subgroup of `W.M` containing `im μ` bounds `2 ^ rank W(K) * #W(K)[2]` from above.

## Implementation notes

`card_range_μ` is where the rank enters, through
`AddSubgroup.index_range_nsmul_of_fg` (`TauCeti/GroupTheory/Index/NSmul.lean`): the index of
`2 • W(K)` in `W(K)` is `2 ^ rank * #W(K)[2]` for a finitely generated group. Mathlib's
`AddSubgroup.index_range_nsmul` is the free case only, and the torsion factor is exactly what
the rank bound has to carry, so the free case cannot be substituted here.

`pow_rank_le_card_of_range_μ_le` takes `S` and `[Finite S]` as hypotheses rather than using
`selmerGroup₂` directly. The finiteness of the 2-Selmer group is a separate theorem; stating the
bound this way lets it be applied to any finite group known to contain the image, and keeps this
file independent of that finiteness proof.

## Provenance

Adapted from Michael Stoll's `EllipticCurves` project
(`github.com/MichaelStollBayreuth/EllipticCurves`, Apache-2.0, pinned by
`TauCetiRoadmap/EllipticCurves/README.md` at `66889eada51a`), `EllipticCurves/SelmerGroup.lean`,
its `SelmerGroup` section — declarations `selmerGroup₂`, `mem_selmerGroup₂_iff`,
`range_μ_le_selmerGroup₂`, `card_range_μ` and `pow_rank_le_card_of_range_μ_le`.

Two of the source's conventions are dropped in favour of this repository's. Square classes are
spelled `W.M`, the quotient of `W.Aˣ` by the range of `powMonoidHom 2`, following `XSubT.lean`;
the source's local `Units.modPow` abbreviation is not carried, per the convention recorded in
`XSubT.lean` and `LocalCondition.lean`. And there is no `[DecidableEq K]` section variable:
every declaration here is under `open scoped Classical in`, as in `LocalCondition.lean`.

That second choice is forced, not cosmetic. `DecidableEq K` is what Mathlib's `AddCommGroup
W.Point` instance requires, so `μ` carries it as an instance argument (`XSubT.lean`, where it is
a section variable). `range_μ_le_localCondition` lives in `LocalCondition.lean`, which works
under `open scoped Classical`, so the `μ` in its statement is already pinned to
`Classical.propDecidable`. A file that consumes both that lemma and the group structure of
`W.Point` must therefore supply the same instance: with a `DecidableEq K` section variable the
two disagree and `range_μ_le_selmerGroup₂` will not typecheck, and with neither, `AddGroup
W.Point` fails to synthesize at all.
