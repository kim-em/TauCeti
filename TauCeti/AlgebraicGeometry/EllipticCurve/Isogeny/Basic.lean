# Isogenies of Weierstrass curves

An isogeny between affine Weierstrass curves over a field is represented contravariantly by a
pullback from the target coordinate ring to the source function field. The pullback is required to
send the source point at infinity to the target point at infinity. Algebraically, this means that
the source coordinate ring is integral over the image of the target coordinate ring.

This file introduces that data and its identity element. The integrality condition installs the
algebra structure induced by the chosen pullback only locally: different pullbacks generally give
different algebra structures on the same function field, so registering one globally would create
a typeclass diamond.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.CoordinatePullback`: the contravariant coordinate-ring map of a morphism.
* `TauCeti.CoordinatePullback.MapsInfinity`: the integrality condition expressing pointedness.
* `TauCeti.Isogeny`: a coordinate pullback satisfying `MapsInfinity`.
* `TauCeti.Isogeny.id`: the identity isogeny.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.CoordinatePullback.mapsInfinity_iff`: pointedness says exactly that the source
  coordinate ring is integral over the target acting through the pullback.
* `TauCeti.CoordinatePullback.mapsInfinity_id`: the integrality witness for the identity pullback,
  which with `mapsInfinity_iff` is what makes `TauCeti.Isogeny.id` an isogeny.

The coordinate-ring universal property used to build and move pullbacks is stated at its natural
generality in `Affine/Eval.lean`, as `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.CoordinateRing.algHom_ext`.
`Isogeny/MulByInt/Basic.lean` makes `[n]` from the
division-polynomial point, and `Isogeny/BaseChange.lean` carries a pullback along a change of base
field by carrying its point. The identity and Frobenius pullbacks instead come directly from their
underlying ring maps.

This is the opening milestone of Layer 1 of the elliptic-curves roadmap. The definition is the
coordinate-ring form of D. Angdinata's function-field definition of an isogeny. The geometric
interpretation follows Silverman, *The Arithmetic of Elliptic Curves*, II.2.4. No ellipticity or
normality assumption is needed to state the data.
