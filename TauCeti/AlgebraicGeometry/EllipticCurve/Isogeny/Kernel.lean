# The kernel of an isogeny

An isogeny is a map of function fields, so it has no point map to take a fibre of. Its kernel is
read off the translation action instead: a point `P` of `W₁` lies in the kernel exactly when
translating by `P` moves no function pulled back from `W₂`. On the points where the two notions
can be compared this is the usual kernel, since `φ(X + P) = φ(X) + φ(P)`, and it is stated here
for every isogeny over every field, with no separability or rationality hypothesis.

The degree bounds the kernel: a pulled-back field of degree `d` is fixed by at most `d`
translations. The bound is often strict, because these are the `F`-rational points only: a
separable isogeny whose geometric kernel is not rational has fewer of them than its degree.
Equality needs separability *and* rationality of the whole geometric kernel. For `1 − π_q` over a
finite field both hold, its geometric kernel being the `𝔽_q`-rational points, and the point count
`deg (1 − π_q) = #E(𝔽_q)` is what they then yield; neither that identity nor the general equality
is proved here.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.Isogeny.ker`: the subgroup of points whose translation fixes the pulled-back field.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Isogeny.mem_ker_iff_map_tautologicalPoint_eq`: membership is fixing the pullback's
  tautological point.
* `TauCeti.Isogeny.card_ker_le_degree`: the kernel has at most `deg φ` elements.
* `TauCeti.Isogeny.ker_le_ker_comp`: postcomposition can only enlarge the kernel.
* `TauCeti.Isogeny.ker_eq_bot_of_separableDegree_eq_one`: separable degree one forces this kernel
  to be trivial, as for Frobenius.
* `TauCeti.Isogeny.card_ker_eq_degree_iff`: the cardinality statement is *equivalent* to the
  reverse fixed-field inclusion.
* `TauCeti.Isogeny.card_ker_eq_degree_of_forall_exists_translation` and
  `card_ker_eq_degree_iff_isGalois_and_forall_exists_translation`: it holds exactly when the
  function field is Galois over the pulled-back field and every automorphism over that field is a
  translation, so those two conditions are what remains of the identity.
* `TauCeti.Isogeny.card_ker_dvd_separableDegree` and `card_ker_le_separableDegree`: the kernel
  order divides, so is bounded by, the separable degree.

## Provenance

The AINTLIB `HasseWeil` project (Chris Birkbeck, Apache 2.0, commit
`513e83879e2f8cbc626eb9e04d660e92be16ccba`) proves the corresponding cardinality statement in
`EC/SeparableKernelTorsor.lean` as `card_kernel_eq_degree_of_separable_isogeny`, parametric on two
witnesses. The second exists only because its isogeny carries a point map independent of the
function-field pullback, so separability and the kernel are a priori unrelated there. The kernel
here is defined from the pullback, so that witness has no counterpart.

/-- **An isogeny of separable degree one has a trivial kernel here**, the bound leaving no room.
This is the right hypothesis: a purely inseparable isogeny such as Frobenius has separable degree
one, so its kernel in this point-valued sense is trivial whatever its degree — its scheme-theoretic
kernel, which this file does not model, is not. -/

/-- **The kernel counts the degree exactly when it cuts out the pulled-back field.** This is a
*reduction*, not the separable-locus theorem: one inclusion holds for free, so the cardinality
statement and the reverse inclusion are two names for the same thing.

That inclusion is where separability enters, and over a base field that is not separably closed it
can fail: the kernel here consists of the rational points, while the extension is cut out by the
geometric ones. Deriving it from separability and rationality of the geometric kernel is not done
here. -/

given the Galois hypothesis, what is left of `deg φ = #ker φ` is a statement about automorphisms,
not about fields — are there automorphisms of `K(W₁)` over `φ^*K(W₂)` beyond the translations by
kernel points? -/
