# The tautological point of `1 − π`

The tautological point is additive on morphisms, and the identity's is the generic point, so the
tautological point of `1 − π_q` is the generic point minus that of Frobenius.

Transported into an extension `Ω` of `F` along a homomorphism `σ` of the function field, that
reads `Q − Q^q` for `Q = σ(g)` the image there of the generic point. This is the form the
embedding count of `1 − π_q` is built from, and the rest of the file draws the two consequences it
needs. The left-hand side depends on `σ` only through the pulled-back field, so two homomorphisms
agreeing there give points `Q_σ`, `Q_τ` whose difference is fixed by the `q`-power map; and a
point of `W` over `Ω` fixed by that map descends to a point over `F`. Together these say that the
embeddings over the pulled-back field are indexed injectively by rational points, which is what
bounds the degree of `1 − π_q` by the point count.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Isogeny.tautologicalPoint_oneSubFrobeniusIsogeny`: the tautological point of
  `1 − π_q` is `g − π_q(g)`.
* `TauCeti.Isogeny.map_tautologicalPoint_oneSubFrobeniusIsogeny`: transported along `σ`, it is
  `Q − Q^q`.
* `TauCeti.Isogeny.map_frobeniusAlgHom_sub_map_genericPoint_eq_self`: two homomorphisms agreeing
  on the pulled-back field move the generic point by a `q`-power-fixed difference.
* `TauCeti.Isogeny.exists_baseChange_eq_sub_map_genericPoint`: that difference is the image of a
  rational point.

move the generic point by a rational point. -/
