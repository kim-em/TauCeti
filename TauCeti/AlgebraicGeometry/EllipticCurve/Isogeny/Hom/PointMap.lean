# The action of a morphism on points

A morphism `f : Hom W₁ W₂` of elliptic curves is recorded by its tautological point, a point of
`W₂` over the function field of `W₁`. Its value at a point `P` of `W₁` is the reduction of that
point at the place of `P` (`WeierstrassCurve.Affine.reductionOfDegreeEqOne`). This file defines
that map, `Hom.pointMap`, and proves the facts that make it the action of `f` on points:

* it is additive **in the morphism**;
* for an isogeny `φ`, the place of `φ P` is the restriction of the place of `P` along `φ^*`,
  and composites act by composition;
* the zero morphism sends every point to `O` and the identity fixes every point;
* for a separable isogeny over a separably closed field it agrees with the additive class-group
  point map `TauCeti.Isogeny.toPointHom`, so it is additive there.

**Rigidity.** A nonzero morphism has finite fibres on points. Thus two morphisms agreeing on
infinitely many points are equal. Over a separably closed field the points are infinitely many,
and a morphism is determined by its action on them.

Rigidity yields **additivity of composition in the inner variable** wherever the outer morphism
acts additively on points. That every morphism does, and hence that composition is additive in
the inner morphism over every field, is proved in `Isogeny/Hom/Ring.lean`.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.Isogeny.Hom.pointMap`: the action of a morphism on points.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Isogeny.Hom.add_pointMap`: the action is additive in the morphism.
* `TauCeti.Isogeny.Hom.pointMap_ofIsogeny_eq_iff`: an isogeny sends `P` to `Q` exactly when the
  place of `P` restricts along its pullback to the place of `Q`.
* `TauCeti.Isogeny.Hom.pointMap_ofIsogeny_eq_iff_restrict`: the criterion as equality of places.
* `TauCeti.Isogeny.Hom.comp_pointMap`: a composite acts by composition.
* `TauCeti.Isogeny.Hom.pointMap_ofIsogeny_eq_toPointHom`: for a separable isogeny over a
  separably closed field the action is the class-group point map.
* `TauCeti.Isogeny.Hom.finite_setOf_pointMap_eq`: a nonzero morphism has finite fibres.
* `TauCeti.Isogeny.Hom.eq_of_infinite_setOf_pointMap_eq` and `TauCeti.Isogeny.Hom.ext_pointMap`:
  rigidity.
* `TauCeti.Isogeny.Hom.ext_pointMap_of_prime_zsmul_eq_zero`: rigidity on prime torsion, over a
  separably closed field.
* `TauCeti.Isogeny.Hom.comp_add_of_pointMap_add`: composition is additive in the inner morphism
  when the outer point map is additive and the source has infinitely many points.
