# The Frobenius trace of a reduction, and the local polynomial

Over the fraction field of a discrete valuation ring with finite residue field, the reduction of a
minimal Weierstrass equation is a Weierstrass model over a finite field, so it has a Frobenius
trace `a = q + 1 − #W(k)`, counted with its singular point. This file evaluates that trace at bad
reduction: it is `1` at split multiplicative, `-1` at nonsplit multiplicative, and `0` at additive
reduction. At good reduction it is the classical trace `q + 1 − #E(k)` of the smooth reduction.

These are exactly the coefficients of `T` in Mathlib's `WeierstrassCurve.localPolynomial`, which
is defined by cases on the reduction type. Read through the trace, the case split collapses: the
local polynomial is `1 − a T + q T²` at good reduction and `1 − a T` otherwise.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.reduction_Δ_eq_zero_iff`,
  `WeierstrassCurve.HasMultiplicativeReduction.reduction_c₄_ne_zero`,
  `WeierstrassCurve.HasMultiplicativeReduction.reduction_c₆_ne_zero` and
  `WeierstrassCurve.HasAdditiveReduction.reduction_c₄_eq_zero`: the reduction types read on the
  invariants of the reduced model.
* `WeierstrassCurve.HasMultiplicativeReduction.splits_nodePolynomial_reduction_iff`: a
  multiplicative reduction is split exactly when the reduced model's node polynomial splits.
* `WeierstrassCurve.HasSplitMultiplicativeReduction.frobeniusTrace_reduction_eq_one`,
  `WeierstrassCurve.HasMultiplicativeReduction.frobeniusTrace_reduction_eq_neg_one` and
  `WeierstrassCurve.HasAdditiveReduction.frobeniusTrace_reduction_eq_zero`: the trace of the
  reduction is `1`, `-1` and `0` at split multiplicative, nonsplit multiplicative and additive
  reduction.
* `WeierstrassCurve.localPolynomial_eq_of_hasGoodReduction` and
  `WeierstrassCurve.localPolynomial_eq_of_not_hasGoodReduction`: the local polynomial is
  `1 − a T + q T²` at good reduction and `1 − a T` at bad reduction, with `a` the trace of the
  reduction.
