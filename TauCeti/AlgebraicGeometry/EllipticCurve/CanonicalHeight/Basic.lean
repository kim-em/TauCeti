# The canonical (Néron–Tate) height

The naïve height `h` is quadratic only up to a bounded error: `approx_parallelogram_law` gives a
constant `C` with `|h(P + Q) + h(P - Q) - 2(h P + h Q)| ≤ C`. Tate's observation is that averaging
that error away along the doubling map removes it. This file carries
out that construction and records the facts that pin the definition down: the limit exists, it
stays within a bounded distance of `h`, and it takes the expected values at `0` and under
negation, and it is *honestly* quadratic — it satisfies the parallelogram law exactly, which is
what the whole averaging was for.

`canonicalHeight P = lim_{n → ∞} h(2ⁿ P) / 4ⁿ`

The naïve height here is the height of the `x`-coordinate. We use the normalisation obtained by
averaging this height itself; the associated pairing and regulator use the same normalisation.

## Main definitions

* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.Point.canonicalHeight`: the limit above.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.canonicalHeightQuadratic`: the canonical height as a `ℤ`-quadratic map
  with real values, which is the form Mathlib's polarisation API consumes.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.neronTatePairing`: the **Néron–Tate pairing**, the bilinear form
  associated with that quadratic map.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.Point.tendsto_naiveHeight_two_pow_nsmul_div_four_pow`: the defining
  limit is attained, so `canonicalHeight` is the limit and not the junk value `limUnder`
  returns when a sequence does not converge. Properties that genuinely need passage to the limit
  are proved by transporting a property of `h` along this; the values at `0` and under negation
  do not, and are proved termwise instead.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.Point.canonicalHeight_zero` and
  `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.Point.canonicalHeight_neg`: its values at the two points every consumer
  meets first, as `@[simp]` normal forms.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.Point.canonicalHeight_parallelogram_law`: the canonical height
  satisfies the parallelogram law **exactly**, where the naïve height satisfies it only up to a
  bounded error. This is the point of the construction: it is the quadratic function the naïve
  height was approximating.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.Point.canonicalHeight_two_nsmul`: the doubling normal form
  `canonicalHeight (2 • P) = 4 * canonicalHeight P`, the parallelogram law at `Q = P`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.Point.canonicalHeight_zsmul` and
  `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.Point.canonicalHeight_nsmul`: the value at `n • P` is `n ^ 2` times the
  value at `P`. This exhibits the canonical height as a quadratic form on `W.Point`; the general
  statement it specialises lives in `TauCeti/LinearAlgebra/QuadraticForm/OfParallelogram.lean`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.Point.canonicalHeight_nonneg`: it is non-negative, read off the
  defining sequence termwise.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.Point.canonicalHeight_eq_zero_iff_isOfFinAddOrder`: it vanishes exactly
  on the torsion points. The two directions are also available separately, because they need
  different hypotheses: `canonicalHeight_eq_zero_of_isOfFinAddOrder` is quadraticity at a
  vanishing multiple and needs no finiteness, while `isOfFinAddOrder_of_canonicalHeight_eq_zero`
  assumes Northcott finiteness for the canonical height itself.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.Point.abs_canonicalHeight_sub_naiveHeight_le`: the canonical height stays
  within a bounded distance of the naïve one, by a
  constant depending only on the curve. This is what makes the two interchangeable in
  finiteness arguments — in particular Northcott finiteness transfers to it, which the `Northcott`
  instance below makes formal.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.neronTatePairing_apply`: the pairing is the polarisation — its value
  at `P, Q` is half of `canonicalHeight (P + Q) - canonicalHeight P - canonicalHeight Q`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.neronTatePairing_self`: it recovers the canonical height on the
  diagonal, so the pairing and the height determine each other.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.neronTatePairing_eq_zero_of_isOfFinAddOrder_left` and
  `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.neronTatePairing_eq_zero_of_isOfFinAddOrder_right`: it vanishes as soon
  as either argument is torsion, which is what lets it descend to the free quotient
  `W.Point ⧸ torsion` where the regulator is defined.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.neronTatePairing_comm` and
  `WeierstrassCurve.Affine.neronTatePairing_flip`: it is symmetric, pointwise and as an equality
  of bilinear maps.

## Implementation notes

The doubling bound `|h(2P) - 4 h(P)| ≤ C` is the approximate parallelogram law at `Q = P`, where
`P - Q = 0` and `h(0) = 0`. **Convergence** needs only that specialisation, which is why it is
private; `canonicalHeight_parallelogram_law` needs the full two-point law, and takes it directly
from `approx_parallelogram_law`.

Convergence is `cauchySeq_of_le_geometric` at ratio `1/4`: consecutive terms of
`h(2ⁿ P) / 4ⁿ` differ by
`|h(2 · 2ⁿ P) - 4 h(2ⁿ P)| / 4ⁿ⁺¹ ≤ C / 4ⁿ⁺¹ = (C/4) · (1/4)ⁿ`. The same estimate
feeds Mathlib's
`dist_le_of_le_geometric_of_tendsto₀`, which bounds the distance from the *zeroth* term — and the
zeroth term is `h(P)` — giving `|canonicalHeight P - h(P)| ≤ (C / 4) / (1 - 1/4) = C / 3`
with no further work.

The `[DecidableEq F]` hypothesis is not incidental: `W.Point`'s `AddCommGroup` instance needs it,
since the addition formula case-splits on whether the two points share an `x`-coordinate. Without
it `2 ^ n • P` does not elaborate.

-- `QuadraticMap.associated_flip` as the general-target version for exactly this reason.
