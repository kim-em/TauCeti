# The Bosma–Lenstra addition laws land on the curve over any ring

Let `W'` be a Weierstrass curve in projective coordinates over a commutative ring `R`, and let `P`
and `Q` be solutions of its homogeneous equation. This file shows that the two Bosma–Lenstra
addition laws attached to the lines `Z = 0` and `Y = 0`, namely Mathlib's
`WeierstrassCurve.Projective.addXYZ` and Tau Ceti's `WeierstrassCurve.Projective.dblAddXYZ`, take
`P` and `Q` to solutions of the equation again. The curve `W'` is arbitrary, possibly singular, and
`P` and `Q` are arbitrary solutions, not necessarily nonsingular and not necessarily with
coordinates generating the unit ideal.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.Projective.Equation.addXYZ`: if `P` and `Q` satisfy the equation of `W'`, so
  does `W'.addXYZ P Q`.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Projective.Equation.dblAddXYZ`: if `P` and `Q` satisfy the equation of `W'`,
  so does `W'.dblAddXYZ P Q`.

  J. Number Theory 53 (1995), 229–240.

## Provenance

New in Tau Ceti; no code was ported. AINTLIB (`github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB`, Apache-2.0, commit
`c3415f32a313e19ace43e05479aeaa0d56ca287a`, file
`projects/ModularCurves/ModularCurves/EllipticCurve/AdditionLawOnCurve.lean`) has the two
statements as `equation_addXYZ_of_isJacobsonRing` and `equation_dblAddXYZ_of_isJacobsonRing`, for
curves with unit discriminant over reduced Jacobson rings.

-- Both statements are proved once for a universal pair of solutions and then specialized. Over

-- domain, and so is the homogeneous coordinate ring `Ring₂` of the universal curve over `Ring₁`
-- (`instIsDomainCoordinateRing`). Over the fraction field of `Ring₂` the universal curve has
-- nonzero discriminant and the two universal solutions are nonzero, hence nonsingular, so the
-- field statements apply there and descend to `Ring₂` by injectivity.
