# Unimodular solutions of the projective Weierstrass equation

For a Weierstrass curve `W` over a commutative ring `R`, a projective point class `[X : Y : Z]` is
*unimodular* if it is represented by a solution of the projective Weierstrass equation whose
coordinates are unimodular, that is, generate the unit ideal of `R`. Over a local ring these are
exactly the solutions one of whose coordinates is a unit, and they describe the `R`-points of the
projective Weierstrass model.

Mathlib's `WeierstrassCurve.Projective.NonsingularLift` is the corresponding condition with
nonsingularity in place of unimodularity, and it is only meaningful over a field. Over a field and
for an elliptic curve the two conditions agree, which identifies the unimodular classes with
Mathlib's nonsingular projective points `WeierstrassCurve.Projective.Point`.

## Main definitions

* `WeierstrassCurve.Projective.UnimodularLift`: the proposition that a projective point class is
  represented by a solution of the projective Weierstrass equation with unimodular coordinates.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Projective.Point.equivUnimodularLift`: on an elliptic curve over a field, the
  nonsingular projective points are the unimodular point classes.

## Main results

* `WeierstrassCurve.Projective.unimodularLift_iff`: the condition on a representative.
* `WeierstrassCurve.Projective.unimodularLift_iff_nonsingularLift`: on an elliptic curve over a
  field, a point class is unimodular if and only if it is nonsingular.

/-- The proposition that a projective point class on a Weierstrass curve `W` is represented by a
solution of the projective Weierstrass equation with unimodular coordinates, that is, coordinates
generating the unit ideal.

If `P` is a projective point representative on `W`, then `W.UnimodularLift ⟦P⟧` is equivalent to
`W.Equation P ∧ Module.IsUnimodular R P` (`unimodularLift_iff`). Over a local ring these classes
correspond to the `R`-points of the projective Weierstrass model. -/
