# Placing a square matrix in the upper-left block of the next size

A square matrix of size `n` becomes one of size `n + 1` by putting it in the upper-left block and
filling the last row and column with those of the identity matrix.  This file builds that map,
`Matrix.blockSucc`, and shows it is multiplicative, unital and injective, and that it leaves the
determinant unchanged while adding `1` to the trace.

The construction is written with `Fin.snoc` rather than as `Matrix.fromBlocks M 0 0 1` reindexed
along `finSumFinEquiv`, because `Fin (n + 1)` is the index type the general linear groups and their
standard representations are stated over: a `Fin n ⊕ Fin 1` presentation would have to be
reindexed away again at once.

`TauCeti/LinearAlgebra/Matrix/GeneralLinearGroup/BlockSucc.lean` deduces from this the **block
inclusion** `TauCeti.glBlockSucc : GL (Fin n) k →* GL (Fin (n + 1)) k`, the embedding that fixes
the last basis vector.

## Main definitions

* `Matrix.blockSucc`: a square matrix placed in the upper-left block of the next size, with the
  last row and column of the identity matrix.
* `Matrix.blockSuccMonoidHom`: the same map, bundled as a monoid homomorphism.  It is *not*
  additive: the last diagonal entry is `1` for every `M`, so `blockSucc 0` is not `0`.

## Main results

* `Matrix.blockSucc_mulVec`: the extended matrix acts on the first `n` coordinates by `M` and
  fixes the last one.
* `Matrix.transpose_blockSucc`: extending a matrix commutes with transposing it, the last row and
  column of the identity matrix being exchanged with each other.
* `Matrix.trace_blockSucc` and `Matrix.det_blockSucc`: the trace grows by one and the determinant
  is unchanged.
