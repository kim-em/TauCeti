# Special linear groups: reduction, centers, and coordinate descriptions

The natural reduction map `SL₂(ℤ) → SL₂(ℤ/dℤ)` is surjective (strong approximation for
`SL₂`; Shimura §1.6, Serre Ch. VII) — jointly so at two coprime moduli, by the Chinese
remainder theorem — and the base-change map `SL(n, R) → GL(n, S)` sends
`-I` to `-I`. Base change is functorial: `SL(n, -)` carries a composite of ring homs to the
composite of the induced group homs, and the identity to the identity, which is what lets a
congruence on a whole matrix be reduced along a further ring map in one step rather than entry
by entry. Basic coordinate descriptions for `SL₂` and its image under `mapGL` are also
recorded here for downstream matrix computations, together with what the determinant says about
a matrix with a prescribed bottom row `(N, p)`: it is the Bézout relation `m p - n N = 1`.

`mem_center_iff_eq_one_or_eq_neg_one` pins down `±I` itself, which is what the base-change
statement moves around:
over a commutative ring without zero divisors the centre of `SL₂` is exactly `{±I}`, the
scalar form Mathlib gives having no other square roots of `1` to offer.

The general positive-size center is identified with the corresponding roots-of-unity group by
specializing Mathlib's finite-index-type equivalence to `Fin n`.

The surjectivity is ported from the AINTLIB `LeanModularForms` project
(`LeanModularForms/HeckeRIngs/GLn/SL2Surjection.lean`, Chris Birkbeck). Prerequisite for the
diamond operators of the ModularForms roadmap (Layer 0), where it realizes every unit of
`ZMod N` as the lower-right entry of a matrix in `Γ₀(N)`.

The two-modulus form generalizes an ad-hoc instance from the same project at commit
`2baa76f742bdb4fb8ee323fabba41203bd390e08` (Apache-2.0):
`LeanModularForms/StrongMultiplicityOne/DescentCosets.lean` proves `descendExtraGamma_exists`
for the single coprime pair `(p, N / p)`. The statement here is the general coprime pair, and the
proof is independent of the source's.

## Main results

* `Matrix.SpecialLinearGroup.map_intCast_zmod_surjective`: strong approximation for `SL₂`,
  with `Matrix.SpecialLinearGroup.map_intCast_zmod_prod_surjective` its two-modulus form:
  reductions prescribed at coprime `d` and `d'` are realized by one integral matrix.
* `Matrix.SpecialLinearGroup.map_comp` and `Matrix.SpecialLinearGroup.map_id`: the two functor
  laws for base change, which support whole-matrix reduction arguments such as the level
  antitonicity of the principal congruence subgroups.
* `Matrix.SpecialLinearGroup.mapGL_neg_one`: `mapGL S (-1) = -1`.
* `Matrix.SpecialLinearGroup.vecMul_eq_iff_eq_vecMul_inv`: right multiplication of row vectors
  by `g` is inverted by `g⁻¹`.
* `Matrix.SpecialLinearGroup` is countable when its coefficient ring is.
* `Matrix.SpecialLinearGroup.fin_two_mul_sub_mul_eq_one`: the determinant-one identity in
  coordinates.
* `Matrix.SpecialLinearGroup.coe_mapGL_fin_two`: the entrywise matrix of `mapGL S` on `SL₂(R)`,
  with `coe_mapGL_int_rat_fin_two` its `ℤ`-to-`ℚ` specialization.
* `Matrix.SpecialLinearGroup.mul_sub_mul_eq_one_of_lowerRow`: a bottom row `(N, p)` gives the
  Bézout relation `m p - n N = 1`.
* `Matrix.SpecialLinearGroup.centerMulEquivRootsOfUnityFin`: the center of `SL(Fin n, A)` is
  `rootsOfUnity n A` when `0 < n`.
* `Matrix.SpecialLinearGroup.mem_center_iff_eq_one_or_eq_neg_one`: the centre of `SL₂` is
  `{±I}` when `R` has no zero divisors.
* `Matrix.SpecialLinearGroup.finite_center` and
  `Matrix.SpecialLinearGroup.card_center_le_two`: that centre is finite, of order at most two.
* `Matrix.SpecialLinearGroup.disjoint_center_iff_neg_one_notMem`: the simp-normal form of the
  `= 1` case, `Disjoint (center _) Γ ↔ -I ∉ Γ`.
* `Matrix.SpecialLinearGroup.card_center_subgroupOf_eq_two_iff` and
  `Matrix.SpecialLinearGroup.card_center_subgroupOf_eq_one_iff`: for a subgroup `Γ ≤ SL₂`, the
  part of the centre that `Γ` contains has order `2` exactly when `-I ∈ Γ` and `1` exactly when
  it does not — both under `-1 ≠ 1`, which fails exactly when `(2 : R) = 0`.
* `Matrix.SpecialLinearGroup.card_center_subgroupOf_eq_one_or_two`: that order is `1` or `2`,
  needing no hypothesis beyond `NoZeroDivisors R`.

/-- **The centre of `SL₂` is `{±I}`** over any commutative ring without zero divisors.

`Matrix.SpecialLinearGroup.mem_center_iff` puts a central element in scalar form `r • I` with
`r ^ 2 = 1`; without zero divisors the only such scalars are `±1`, which turns that existential
into an alternative. The hypothesis is needed, not incidental — over `ZMod 8` the scalar `3`
also squares to `1`, so the centre is strictly larger than `{±I}` there.

`@[simp]` because the rewrite terminates: it takes a structured membership to a disjunction of
equalities, and nothing rewrites `γ ∈ Subgroup.center _` first — Mathlib's general

/-- **`Γ` meets the centre only in the identity exactly when it does not contain `-I`.**
`Disjoint` of subgroups is triviality of the intersection, not emptiness — `1` lies in both
however `Γ` is chosen — so the content is that `-I` is the only other candidate. This is
`card_center_subgroupOf_eq_one_iff` restated at its simp-normal form: `simp` rewrites
`Nat.card (center.subgroupOf Γ) = 1` through `Subgroup.card_eq_one` and
`Subgroup.subgroupOf_eq_bot` into `Disjoint (center _) Γ`, and this is the rule that then
finishes the job. Stating it separately is what makes the `= 1` case simp-reachable at all,
since the cardinality form cannot itself carry `@[simp]`.

Needs `(2 : R) ≠ 0` for the same reason as the `= 2` companion: in characteristic `2` the centre
is the singleton `{I}`, so it is disjoint from every `Γ` — while `-I = I ∈ Γ` for *every* `Γ`,
including `⊥`, since `I` always lies in a subgroup. Without the hypothesis the equivalence fails
