# The non-split torus of `GL₂`

Let `E/F` be a field extension of degree `2`. Choosing an `F`-basis of `E` presents multiplication
by an element of `E` as a `2 × 2` matrix over `F`, and multiplication by a *nonzero* element as an
element of `GL (Fin 2) F`. The image of `Eˣ` is the **non-split torus**
`TauCeti.GL2NonSplitTorus F E hE`, an abelian subgroup of `GL₂(F)` of order `q² - 1` when `F` has
`q` elements. It is the torus the cuspidal (discrete series) representations of `GL₂(𝔽_q)` are
parametrized by: a character of `Eˣ` in general position determines one of them through the
Deligne–Lusztig construction, which is *not* ordinary induction (the induced representation
`Ind_{Eˣ}^{GL₂(𝔽_q)}` has dimension `q(q - 1)`, while a cuspidal representation has dimension
`q - 1`). This is the elliptic counterpart of the *split* torus of diagonal matrices, whose
characters give the principal series by ordinary induction from the Borel subgroup.

The word *torus* is the algebraic-group one only when `E/F` is separable, which over a finite
field — the setting of the roadmap target — it always is. Degree `2` alone also admits a purely
inseparable `E/F` (characteristic `2` only), where the *algebra* `E ⊗[F] F̄` is the nonreduced
`F̄[X]/(X²)` rather than `F̄ × F̄`. The image of `Eˣ` is then not a torus: after base change to
`F̄` it is the unit group of `F̄[X]/(X²)`, which is `Gₘ × Gₐ` — still smooth and reduced as a
group, but with a nontrivial unipotent part — and its non-scalar elements are not semisimple.
Everything stated below, non-splitness included, is true in that case too: no proof here uses
separability, so no statement assumes it.

"Non-split" is the assertion that, away from the scalars, the torus is not conjugate into the Borel
subgroup: `TauCeti.GL2NonSplitTorus.conj_notMem_gl2Borel` says that if `x : Eˣ` does not lie in `F`
then no conjugate of its matrix is upper triangular. Equivalently the matrix has no eigenvalue in
`F` — over a finite field its eigenvalues are a conjugate pair in `E ∖ F` — which is what makes
these the **elliptic** conjugacy classes of `GL₂(𝔽_q)`. The proof is that the determinant of
`x - a` is the norm `N_{E/F}(x - a)`, which is nonzero because `x - a` is.

The construction depends on the chosen basis `TauCeti.nonSplitTorusBasis`; a different choice
conjugates the subgroup, so the statements that are not conjugation-invariant are stated for this
choice, following the convention of
`TauCetiRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/CharacterTheory/README.md`.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.nonSplitTorusBasis`: a chosen `F`-basis of `E`, indexed by `Fin 2`.
* `TauCeti.GL2NonSplitTorusHom`: the embedding `Eˣ ↪ GL (Fin 2) F` by left multiplication.
* `TauCeti.GL2NonSplitTorus`: its range, the non-split torus.
* `TauCeti.GL2NonSplitTorus.unitsEquiv`: the resulting multiplicative equivalence `Eˣ ≃*` the
  torus.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.GL2NonSplitTorus.natCard_eq`: the torus has `q² - 1` elements over a finite field with
  `q` elements, and `TauCeti.GL2NonSplitTorus.index_eq`: its index is then `q (q - 1)`.
* `TauCeti.GL2NonSplitTorus.conj_notMem_of_det_sub_algebraMap_eq_zero`: a non-scalar element with
  an eigenvalue in `F` has no conjugate in the torus. In particular,
  `TauCeti.GL2NonSplitTorus.conj_notMem_gl2Borel` says an element of the torus not coming from `F`
  has no conjugate in the Borel subgroup, and
  `TauCeti.GL2NonSplitTorus.exists_forall_conj_notMem_gl2Borel`: such an element exists, so the
  torus is not conjugate into the Borel subgroup. What these contradict is
  `TauCeti.GL2Borel.exists_det_sub_algebraMap_eq_zero`, that a matrix with an upper-triangular
  conjugate has an eigenvalue in the base ring.
