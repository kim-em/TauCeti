# The canonical skew-symmetric matrix as a unit, and block matrices in the symplectic group

Mathlib's `Matrix.J` satisfies `J * J = -1`, so it is a unit with inverse `-J`. This file records
that unit and the conjugation cancellation it supports — `X = J * Y * J⁻¹` iff `X * J = J * Y` —
and solves the symplectic inverse formula `SymplecticGroup.inv_eq_symplectic_inv` for the
transpose, `Aᵀ = J * A⁻¹ * J⁻¹`. Conjugation by `J` is the shape the matrix exponential consumes:
the exponential does not interact with `Aᵀ * J = J * (-A)`, but it does turn `Aᵀ = J * (-A) * J⁻¹`
into `(exp A)ᵀ = J * (exp A)⁻¹ * J⁻¹`.

It also records membership in `Matrix.symplecticGroup` of three families of block matrices, each a
specialisation of `SymplecticGroup.fromBlocks_mem_iff`.

## Main results

* `Matrix.J_mul_neg_J`, `Matrix.neg_J_mul_J` and `Matrix.isUnit_J`: the canonical skew-symmetric
  matrix is a unit, with inverse `-J`.
* `Matrix.eq_J_conj_iff_mul_J_eq`: cancelling a conjugation by `J`.
* `SymplecticGroup.transpose_eq_J_conj_inv`: the transpose of a symplectic matrix is the
  `J`-conjugate of its inverse.
* `SymplecticGroup.mem_iff_neg_J_mul_transpose_mul_J_mul_eq_one`: the symplectic matrices are the
  unitary elements for the symplectic adjoint `A ↦ -(J * Aᵀ * J)`.
* `SymplecticGroup.fromBlocks_upper_mem`: `fromBlocks 1 B 0 1` for symmetric `B`;
* `SymplecticGroup.fromBlocks_lower_mem`: `fromBlocks 1 0 C 1` for symmetric `C`;
* `SymplecticGroup.fromBlocks_diagonal_mem`: `fromBlocks A 0 0 D` when `Aᵀ * D = 1`.
