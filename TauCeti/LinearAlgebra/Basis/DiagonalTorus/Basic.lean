# The diagonal torus attached to a weighted basis

A basis `b : Basis ι R M` and a family of units `w : ι → Rˣ` determine the automorphism of `M`
scaling the `i`-th basis vector by `w i`. Letting `w` range over all such families realizes the
group `ι → Rˣ` — the `R`-points of the split torus `𝔾ₘ^ι` — inside the automorphism group of `M`.

Weights cut this down to a torus of smaller rank. A weight function `wt : ι → κ → ℤ` assigns to
each basis vector a character of `𝔾ₘ^κ`, and evaluating those characters at a point
`s : κ → Rˣ` gives the family of units the diagonal automorphism is built from. The resulting
homomorphism `TauCeti.basisWeightTorus` is the split maximal torus of a Chevalley group written
in a weight basis of an admissible lattice, and `TauCeti.basisDiagonal_apply_of_repr_eq_zero` is
the statement that it acts on a weight vector by the corresponding character — which is what makes
the conjugation formula against a root subgroup come out.

Fixing the weight instead of the point turns a character into a homomorphism
`TauCeti.weightChar` on the points of the torus, which is the form in which a weight indexes a
joint eigenspace. Whether that indexing is faithful depends on the coefficients: over `𝔽₂` the
torus has a single point, so every weight gives the trivial character, while over an infinite
field distinct weights stay distinct (`TauCeti.weightChar_injective`).

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.torusCharacter`: the value at `s : κ → Rˣ` of the character `μ : κ → ℤ` of `𝔾ₘ^κ`.
* `TauCeti.weightChar`: that character with the weight fixed, as a homomorphism on the points of
  the torus.
* `TauCeti.weylReflectTorusPoint`: the multiplicative reflection of split-torus points dual to a
  reflection of their character lattice.
* `TauCeti.basisDiagonal`: the automorphism scaling each basis vector by a prescribed unit.
* `TauCeti.basisDiagonalHom`: the resulting homomorphism from `ι → Rˣ`.
* `TauCeti.basisWeightTorus`: the homomorphism from `κ → Rˣ` determined by a weight function.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.basisDiagonal_apply_of_repr_eq_zero`: a diagonal automorphism acts by a single scalar
  on any vector whose coordinates are supported where that scalar is attained.
* `TauCeti.basisWeightTorus_apply_of_repr_eq_zero`: the special case for a weight vector.
* `TauCeti.conj_basisWeightTorus_of_map_basis`: a compatible monomial basis automorphism
  conjugates represented torus points by coordinate reindexing.
* `TauCeti.map_basisWeightTorus_range_conj_of_map_basis`: such an automorphism normalizes the
  represented weight torus.
* `TauCeti.mul_inv_weylReflectTorusPoint`: a point divided by its reflection is supported at the
  reflecting coordinate, with value there the root character.
* `TauCeti.torusCharacter_weylReflectTorusPoint`: evaluation at a reflected point agrees with
  evaluation of the reflected character.
* `TauCeti.exists_torusCharacter_eq_of_sum_mul_eq_one`: a weight whose coordinates have a
  `ℤ`-linear combination equal to one takes every unit as a value.
* `TauCeti.weightChar_injective`: over an infinite field, distinct weights give distinct
  characters of the torus; `TauCeti.weightChar_injective_of_algebraRat` specializes this to
  fields that are `ℚ`-algebras, and `TauCeti.exists_torusCharacter_ne` reads it pointwise.
* `TauCeti.eq_of_span_eq_top_of_torusCharacter_eq`: dually, weights generating the whole character
  lattice separate the points of the torus, over any coefficient ring.
* `TauCeti.basisDiagonalHom_injective` and `TauCeti.basisWeightTorus_injective`: a diagonal
  automorphism determines its scaling units, so spanning weights make the represented weight torus
  a monomorphism.
