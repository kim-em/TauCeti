# The degree filtration of a Clifford algebra

A Clifford algebra carries two different degree structures, one grading and one filtration, and it
is worth keeping them apart. Mathlib already has the `ℤ/2`-grading `CliffordAlgebra.evenOdd`, which
is a genuine `GradedAlgebra`: the Clifford relation `ι Q m * ι Q m = Q m` preserves the parity of
the number of generators, so parity descends to the quotient. It does *not* preserve the number of
generators, so there is no `ℕ`-grading; what survives is an increasing **filtration** by the number
of generators needed to write an element.

This file builds that filtration. `CliffordAlgebra.filtration Q k` is the `R`-submodule
spanned by the products `ι Q v₁ * ⋯ * ι Q vₙ` with `n ≤ k`, the empty product `1` included, so that
`filtration Q 0` is the module of scalars and `filtration Q 1` adjoins the generators. It is
increasing, multiplicative (`filtration Q i * filtration Q j = filtration Q (i + j)`), exhausts the
algebra, and is preserved by the grade involution, by reversal, and by the functoriality of the
Clifford algebra in the quadratic form.

The construction itself is not special to Clifford algebras: `filtration` is
`TauCeti.Algebra.wordFiltration` specialized to `ι Q`, and the lemmas below that do not use the
Clifford relation are specializations of the generic ones. Its successive quotients use
`TauCeti.Algebra.wordFiltration.GradedPiece`; the universal enveloping algebra carries the same
construction as its PBW filtration.

Following the roadmap, the filtration is *not* the submodule power `LinearMap.range (ι Q) ^ k`:
powers of a submodule of a noncommutative algebra collect the products of *exactly* `k` generators.
The relation between the two is `CliffordAlgebra.filtration_eq_iSup_pow`, which writes
`filtration Q k` as the supremum of those powers over `i ≤ k`; this is the sense in which the
filtration is the "at most `k`" companion of Mathlib's `evenOdd`, whose definition is the analogous
supremum over the `i` of a fixed parity.

## Main definitions

* `CliffordAlgebra.filtration Q k`: the span of the products of at most `k` generators.

## Main results

* `CliffordAlgebra.prod_map_ι_mem_filtration` and
  `CliffordAlgebra.filtration_le_iff`: the products of at most `k` generators lie in the
  `k`-th step and generate it, which is how memberships and bounds are proved.
* `CliffordAlgebra.filtration_eq_pow`: the defining equation, as the `k`-th power of the
  scalars together with `LinearMap.range (ι Q)`.
* `CliffordAlgebra.filtration_mul`: the filtration is multiplicative, and in fact exactly
  so: `filtration Q i * filtration Q j = filtration Q (i + j)`. This is the statement that makes
  the associated graded object an algebra, and it is the prerequisite the roadmap asks for before
  anything downstream; `CliffordAlgebra.filtration_pow` is its iterate and
  `CliffordAlgebra.mul_mem_filtration` its elementwise form.
* `CliffordAlgebra.filtration_succ_eq_sup`: the recursion for the successor step.
* `CliffordAlgebra.filtration_eq_top_of_finrank_le`: over a field, the filtration of a
  finite-dimensional space is exhausted at its dimension.
* `CliffordAlgebra.filtration_eq_iSup_pow`: the comparison with the submodule powers of
  `LinearMap.range (ι Q)`.
* `CliffordAlgebra.filtrationLeadingTerm` and
  `CliffordAlgebra.filtrationLeadingTerm_surjective`: the exterior-power leading-term map
  onto each successive filtration quotient. It is surjective over any `CommRing`; when `2` is
  invertible `CliffordAlgebra.filtrationGradedEquiv_comp_filtrationLeadingTerm` identifies
  it with the inverse of the graded equivalence.
* `CliffordAlgebra.iSup_filtration_eq_top`: the filtration is exhaustive.
* `CliffordAlgebra.involute_mem_filtration`,
  `CliffordAlgebra.reverse_mem_filtration` and
  `CliffordAlgebra.map_mem_filtration`: the filtration is preserved by the grade
  involution, by reversal, and by an isometry of quadratic forms.
* `CliffordAlgebra.contractLeft_mem_filtration_succ` and
  `CliffordAlgebra.contractLeft_mem_filtration`,
  `CliffordAlgebra.changeForm_mem_filtration`, and
  `CliffordAlgebra.changeFormEquiv_map_filtration` and
  `CliffordAlgebra.changeForm_mem_filtration_iff`: contraction and change of
  quadratic form respect the filtration, contraction lowers every positive step by one, and the
  change-form equivalence transports every step exactly.
* `CliffordAlgebra.changeForm_prod_map_ι_sub_prod_map_ι_mem_filtration`: change of form
  has identity symbol, that is, it moves a word of generators only by terms two filtration degrees
  lower.
* `CliffordAlgebra.fg_filtration`: each step is a finitely generated module when `M` is.

/-- The degree filtration of a Clifford algebra: `filtration Q k` is the `R`-submodule spanned by
the products `ι Q v₁ * ⋯ * ι Q vₙ` of at most `k` generators, the empty product `1` included.

This is deliberately not the submodule power `LinearMap.range (ι Q) ^ k`, which spans the products
of exactly `k` generators; see `filtration_eq_iSup_pow` for the comparison.

This is `TauCeti.Algebra.wordFiltration` specialized to `ι Q`. It is an `abbrev`, so that the
generic construction of `TauCeti/Algebra/WordFiltration/AssociatedGraded.lean` applies to the
Clifford filtration: instance synthesis and the rewriting tactics only see through reducible
definitions. -/

/-- The defining equation of the filtration: degree `k` is the `k`-th submodule power of the
scalars together with `LinearMap.range (ι Q)`. Contrast `filtration_eq_iSup_pow`, the comparison
with the powers of `LinearMap.range (ι Q)` alone. -/

/-- **The filtration is multiplicative**, and exactly so. Concatenating a product of at most `i`
generators with a product of at most `j` generators gives a product of at most `i + j` of them, and
conversely a product of at most `i + j` generators splits after its `i`-th factor. In particular the
associated graded object of the filtration is an algebra. -/

/-- **Change of form has identity symbol, and its correction is even.** Transporting a word of at
most `k + 2` generators along `changeForm` changes it only by terms of filtration degree at most
`k`: the difference between the word in the `ι Q` and the same word in the `ι Q'` drops *two*
steps. It corrects by left contractions, and each contraction removes a pair of generators, so a
one-step bound would not be sharp. Mathlib's `changeForm_ι_mul_ι` is the first instance: a
two-generator word is corrected by the scalar `B m₁ m₂`, which lies in `filtration Q' 0`.

Where `changeForm_mem_filtration` says `changeForm` is a filtered map, this says its associated
graded map is the identity. -/
