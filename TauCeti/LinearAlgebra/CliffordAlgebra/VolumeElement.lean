# The volume element of a Clifford algebra

The **volume element** (or pseudoscalar) of a quadratic space is the ordered Clifford product
`ι Q v₁ * ⋯ * ι Q vₙ` of an orthogonal basis. This file proves the facts that make it useful:
how it commutes past a vector, how reversal acts on it, what its square is, and, over a field,
that it moves each of its anisotropic factors out of the vectors once there are at least three of
them and evenly many.

The ordered product is spelled `(l.map (ι Q)).prod` for a list `l` of vectors, the spelling Mathlib
already uses for it (`CliffordAlgebra.involute_prod_map_ι`, `CliffordAlgebra.reverse_prod_map_ι`)
and the one the sibling file `Filtration.lean` uses
(`CliffordAlgebra.prod_map_ι_mem_filtration`); the results below are named `prod_map_ι_*` to
match. Orthogonality is a hypothesis of each result rather than part of the object, so the name
"volume element" is reserved for the informal reading.

Both facts come from the single relation `ι Q a * ι Q b = -(ι Q b * ι Q a)` for orthogonal `a` and
`b`. Pushing a vector `ι Q m` from one side of a product of `n` mutually orthogonal vectors to the
other costs a sign `(-1) ^ n` when `m` is orthogonal to every factor
(`CliffordAlgebra.prod_map_ι_mul_ι_of_forall_isOrtho`). When `m` is instead *one of* the factors,
one of the `n` transpositions is a vector past itself, which is free, so the cost is
`(-1) ^ (n - 1)`. That sign does not depend on `m`, and the condition is linear in `m`, so it
propagates from the factors to their span (`CliffordAlgebra.prod_map_ι_mul_ι_of_mem_span`).

This is the even/odd dichotomy of the Clifford algebra as seen from the volume element. If there
are **oddly** many factors, the volume element commutes with every generator coming from their span
(`CliffordAlgebra.prod_map_ι_mul_ι_of_odd_length`), so once the factors span `M` it is **central**
(`CliffordAlgebra.prod_map_ι_mem_center_of_odd_length`); if there are evenly many, it
**anticommutes** with those generators instead
(`CliffordAlgebra.prod_map_ι_mul_ι_of_even_length`). Centrality is all the odd case claims: under
these hypotheses the volume element may well be a scalar already, and is `0` as soon as one of its
factors is. That it is a *further* central element, and that the centre is then exactly a rank-two
algebra rather than the scalars, is *not* proved here and needs hypotheses this file does not make
— a nondegenerate form over a field away from characteristic two, with the list an orthogonal
basis. For `Q = 0` on `R ^ 3` the Clifford algebra is the exterior algebra and its centre is much
larger instead. The odd-dimensional splitting does run on the volume element:
`TauCeti/LinearAlgebra/CliffordAlgebra/OddSplitting.lean` splits the Clifford algebra as two copies
of its even subalgebra along a central odd square root of one, and
`CliffordAlgebra.equivEvenProdOfOddLength` feeds it the volume element of an orthogonal spanning
list of odd length, rescaled so that the square below is `1`. What remains open there is the
identification of `even Q` with a matrix algebra, for which
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Spin/Structure.lean` proves the even-dimensional structure theorem.

The square is a scalar,
`ω * ω = (-1) ^ (n.choose 2) * Q v₁ ⋯ Q vₙ` (`CliffordAlgebra.prod_map_ι_sq_scalar`), the sign
counting the `n.choose 2` transpositions needed to interleave two copies of the product. So the
volume element is a unit as soon as the product of the values `Q vᵢ` is a unit — over a field,
whenever no factor is isotropic. That last statement (`CliffordAlgebra.isUnit_prod_map_ι`) needs no
orthogonality at all, each factor being a unit already because its square `Q vᵢ` is.

Nothing here needs `2` to be invertible, a field, or any finiteness. Beyond pairwise orthogonality
of the list — which the unit statement does not even ask for — the only hypotheses are the ones
each statement names: that the vector crossing the product lies in the span of the list (or that
the list spans `M`, for the centrality statement), and, for the unit statement, that the product of
the values `Q vᵢ` is a unit.

## Main results

* `CliffordAlgebra.prod_map_ι_mul_ι_of_forall_isOrtho`: a vector orthogonal to every factor
  moves across the product at the cost of `(-1) ^ n`.
* `CliffordAlgebra.prod_map_ι_mul_ι_of_mem_span`: a vector in the span of a pairwise orthogonal
  list moves across the product at the cost of `(-1) ^ (n - 1)`.
* `CliffordAlgebra.prod_map_ι_mul_ι_of_odd_length`: the volume element of a pairwise orthogonal
  list of odd length commutes with every generator in the span of the list.
* `CliffordAlgebra.prod_map_ι_mem_center_of_odd_length`: the volume element of a pairwise
  orthogonal spanning list of odd length is central.
* `CliffordAlgebra.prod_map_ι_mul_ι_of_even_length`: of even length, it anticommutes with every
  generator in the span instead.
* `CliffordAlgebra.prod_map_ι_sq_scalar`: the square of the volume element of a pairwise
  orthogonal list is the scalar `(-1) ^ (n.choose 2) * ∏ᵢ Q vᵢ`.
* `CliffordAlgebra.reverse_prod_map_ι_of_pairwise_isOrtho`: reversal multiplies the volume
  element of a pairwise orthogonal list by the same sign `(-1) ^ (n.choose 2)`.
* `CliffordAlgebra.ι_mul_ι_mul_self_of_isOrtho`: the two-factor case, the square of the product
  of two orthogonal generators being the scalar `-(Q a * Q b)`.
* `CliffordAlgebra.neg_one_pow_choose_two_mul_prod_map_ne_zero`: over a field, that scalar is
  nonzero when no member of the list is isotropic.
* `CliffordAlgebra.isUnit_prod_map_ι`: an ordered product of generators — orthogonal or not — is
  a unit as soon as the product of the values `Q vᵢ` is.
* `CliffordAlgebra.prod_map_ι_mul_ι_notMem_range_ι`: over a field, the volume element of an
  orthogonal anisotropic list of even length at least three moves each member of the list out of
  the vectors.

/-! ### The even/odd dichotomy -/

/-- **The volume element of an odd number of pairwise orthogonal vectors commutes with every
generator coming from their span**, the crossing sign `(-1) ^ (n - 1)` now being `1`.

This is the odd half of the dichotomy, in the same span-relative form as its even counterpart
`prod_map_ι_mul_ι_of_even_length`; `prod_map_ι_mem_center_of_odd_length` is the case of a
spanning list, where commuting with the generators upgrades to centrality. -/

/-- **The volume element of an odd number of pairwise orthogonal vectors spanning `M` is central.**

Crossing a generator costs `(-1) ^ (n - 1)`, and `n - 1` is even, so the volume element commutes
with every generator; the generators generate the algebra, so it commutes with everything.

Centrality is all that is claimed. Under these hypotheses the volume element may already be a
scalar, and is `0` as soon as one of its factors is; it is the element *expected* to generate the
centre beyond the scalars in the odd-dimensional case, but that expectation rests on nondegeneracy
hypotheses made nowhere in this file. -/

Anticommuting does not by itself rule out centrality: it says exactly that

whenever `ω` annihilates the generators, as it does in an exterior algebra. -/
