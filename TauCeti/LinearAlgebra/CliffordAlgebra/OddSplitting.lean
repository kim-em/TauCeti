# Splitting a Clifford algebra along a central odd square root of one

An element `ω` of `CliffordAlgebra Q` which is **central**, **odd**, and squares to `1` splits the
algebra in two. The elements

`e₊ = ½ (1 + ω)`,  `e₋ = ½ (1 - ω)`

are complementary orthogonal idempotents — central as soon as `ω` is, and that much is general
algebra, recorded for an arbitrary `R`-algebra in
`TauCeti/RingTheory/Idempotents/SquareRootOne.lean` — and the resulting decomposition
`Cliff(Q) = e₊ Cliff(Q) ⊕ e₋ Cliff(Q)` has both summands isomorphic to the **even subalgebra**: the
map

`CliffordAlgebra.ofEvenProd : even Q × even Q →ₐ[R] CliffordAlgebra Q`,
`(x, y) ↦ e₊ x + e₋ y`

is an isomorphism of `R`-algebras. That is the content of this file, and it needs nothing beyond
`2` being invertible — no field, no finiteness, no nondegeneracy. Centrality is more than the
proofs use: multiplication only ever moves `ω` past even elements, so the declarations below ask
only that `ω` commute with `even Q`, and it is the volume element application that supplies a
genuinely central `ω`.

Both halves of the proof are short once the grade involution `CliffordAlgebra.involute` is brought
in. *Injectivity* is the statement that an even `x` with `e₊ x = 0` vanishes: from `x + ω x = 0`,
applying `involute` (which fixes `x` and negates `ω`) gives `x - ω x = 0`, and adding the two kills
`ω` and leaves `2 x = 0`. *Surjectivity* never mentions dimensions either: the image of an algebra
map is a subalgebra, the generators `ι Q v` are in it because

`e₊ (ω · ι Q v) + e₋ (-(ω · ι Q v)) = (e₊ - e₋) · ω · ι Q v = ω² · ι Q v = ι Q v`

with `ω · ι Q v` even, and `CliffordAlgebra.adjoin_range_ι` says the generators generate.

The element the theorem is meant for is the **volume element** of
`TauCeti/LinearAlgebra/CliffordAlgebra/VolumeElement.lean`: the ordered product `ω = v₁ ⋯ vₙ` of a
pairwise orthogonal spanning list of **odd** length is central
(`CliffordAlgebra.prod_map_ι_mem_center_of_odd_length`) and odd, and its square is the scalar
`(-1) ^ (n.choose 2) ∏ᵢ Q vᵢ` (`CliffordAlgebra.prod_map_ι_sq_scalar`). Rescaling `ω` by a scalar
`s` whose square inverts that constant normalizes the square to `1`, which is what
`CliffordAlgebra.equivEvenProdOfOddLength` asks for; over a separably closed field of characteristic
not two the rescaling always exists, and
`CliffordAlgebra.nonempty_algEquiv_even_prod_of_isSepClosed` drops the hypothesis in favour of the
orthogonal basis having no isotropic vector.

Only the odd case splits this way. For a list of even length the volume element anticommutes with
the generators coming from the span of the list rather than commuting with them
(`CliffordAlgebra.prod_map_ι_mul_ι_of_even_length`). Anticommutation does not by itself rule out
centrality — in an exterior algebra the volume element annihilates the generators and is central
all the same, as `VolumeElement.lean` records — but it does rule it out under the hypotheses this
file works with: were an even-length `ω` with `ω * ω = 1` central, then `2` being invertible would
give `ι Q m * ω = 0`, hence `ι Q m = ι Q m * ω * ω = 0`, for every `m` in the span of the list. The
even-dimensional Clifford algebra over a separably closed field is instead a matrix algebra, proved
from the spin module in
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Spin/Structure.lean`. Combining that file's even-dimensional
structure theorem with the splitting below is what turns an odd-dimensional Clifford algebra into a
product of two matrix algebras; the identification of `even Q` for an odd-dimensional form with the
Clifford algebra of an even-dimensional one is a separate step and is not carried out here.

## Main definitions

* `CliffordAlgebra.ofEvenProd`: the algebra map `(x, y) ↦ e₊ x + e₋ y` from two copies of the even
  subalgebra, built on `TauCeti.halfOneAdd`.
* `CliffordAlgebra.equivEvenProd`: **the splitting**, that map promoted to an algebra isomorphism
  and read as `CliffordAlgebra Q ≃ₐ[R] even Q × even Q`.
* `CliffordAlgebra.equivEvenProdOfOddLength`: the splitting run on the volume element of a pairwise
  orthogonal spanning list of odd length, once its square has been normalized.

## Main results

* `CliffordAlgebra.eq_zero_of_mem_even_of_halfOneAdd_mul_eq_zero`: an even element killed by `e₊`
  is zero — the grade involution argument that makes the splitting injective.
* `CliffordAlgebra.ofEvenProd_injective` and `CliffordAlgebra.ofEvenProd_surjective`: the two halves
  of `CliffordAlgebra.equivEvenProd`.
* `CliffordAlgebra.coe_equivEvenProd_apply_fst` and `CliffordAlgebra.coe_equivEvenProd_apply_snd`:
  the forward direction of the splitting, `x ↦ (e₊ x + e₋ x̂, e₋ x + e₊ x̂)` with `x̂` the grade
  involution of `x`.
* `CliffordAlgebra.nonempty_algEquiv_even_prod_of_isSepClosed`: over a separably closed field of
  characteristic not two, an orthogonal spanning list of odd length with no isotropic member always
  normalizes, so the Clifford algebra is a product of two copies of its even subalgebra. The
  scalar rescaling comes from an existential there, which is why this one is a `Nonempty`
  statement rather than a definition.
* `CliffordAlgebra.nonempty_algEquiv_even_prod_of_odd_finrank`: the same conclusion for a
  nondegenerate form on a finite-dimensional space of odd dimension, the orthogonal spanning list
  being supplied by `QuadraticMap.Nondegenerate.exists_list_pairwise_isOrtho`.

## Implementation notes

`CliffordAlgebra.equivEvenProd` is oriented `CliffordAlgebra Q ≃ₐ[R] even Q × even Q`, matching
`CliffordAlgebra.equivEven` and the direction in which the structure theorem is usually quoted; its
underlying algebra map `CliffordAlgebra.ofEvenProd` runs the other way, which is the direction in
which the formula `(x, y) ↦ e₊ x + e₋ y` is the readable one, so that formula is stated for
`.symm`. The forward direction is read off the same two idempotents together with the grade
involution, one lemma per component, stated at the level of the underlying Clifford element so that
no membership proof has to appear in the statement.

/-- **Over a separably closed field of characteristic not two the normalization is automatic.**

An orthogonal spanning list of odd length with no isotropic member has a volume element whose
square is a nonzero scalar, and a separably closed field supplies its inverse square root, so the
Clifford algebra of such a form is the product of two copies of its even subalgebra. The square
root is only known to exist, so the conclusion is a `Nonempty`; fixing a root and applying
`CliffordAlgebra.equivEvenProdOfOddLength` names the isomorphism. This is the odd-dimensional half
of the structure theorem, up to the identification of the even subalgebra with a matrix algebra. -/
