# Isometry classes of regular quadratic forms

Over a field in which `2` is invertible, every nondegenerate quadratic form on a
finite-dimensional space is isometric to a weighted sum of squares whose weights are units. This
file turns that diagonalization into a carrier for the isometry classes themselves: a *diagonal
presentation* is a rank `n` together with a tuple `w : Fin n → Kˣ`, presenting the form
`⟨w 0, …, w (n - 1)⟩`, and `TauCeti.RegularFormClass K` is the quotient of the presentations by
isometry of the forms they present.

Presenting classes by tuples of units, rather than by quotienting quadratic forms on arbitrary
finite-dimensional spaces, keeps the carrier in a single universe and makes the type a plain
`Quotient` of a sigma type. Mathlib's `QuadraticMap.Equivalent` already compares forms living on
different spaces, so nothing is lost: two regular forms are isometric exactly when their classes
agree, and only presentations of equal rank are ever related.

Concatenating weight tuples presents the orthogonal sum of the presented forms, which makes the
classes an additive commutative monoid whose zero is the class of the empty presentation and whose
rank is additive.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.RegularFormPresentation`: a rank together with a tuple of unit weights.
* `TauCeti.presentedForm`: the weighted sum of squares a presentation stands for.
* `TauCeti.RegularFormClass`: isometry classes of regular finite-dimensional quadratic forms.
* `TauCeti.RegularFormClass.rank`: the common rank of the presentations in a class.
* `TauCeti.RegularFormPresentation.append`: concatenation of presentations.
* `TauCeti.formClass`: the class of a regular form on a finite-dimensional space.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.RegularFormPresentation.ext`: presentations with the same rank and weights agree.
* `TauCeti.nondegenerate_presentedForm`: a presented form is nondegenerate.
* `QuadraticForm.orthogonalPairIsometryEquiv`: two orthogonal anisotropic vectors identify their
  span with the corresponding diagonal plane.
* `TauCeti.exists_presentedForm_equivalent`: every regular form has a diagonal presentation.
* `TauCeti.formClass_mk`: the class of a form is computed by any of its diagonalizations.
* `TauCeti.formClass_eq_iff`: two regular forms are isometric exactly when their classes agree.
* `TauCeti.RegularFormPresentation.prod_append`: concatenation multiplies the weight products.
* `TauCeti.presentedFormAppendIsometryEquiv`: concatenating weights presents the orthogonal sum.
* `TauCeti.presentedFormConsIsometryEquiv`: peeling the first weight off presents the form as a
  line orthogonal to the presentation of the remaining weights.
* `TauCeti.presentedForm_tail_isRepresentedBy`: the tail of a diagonal presentation is
  represented by the full form.
* `TauCeti.formClass_prod`: the class of an orthogonal product is the sum of the classes.
* `TauCeti.RegularFormClass.mk_succ_eq_mk_rankOne_add`: the class of a presentation of positive
  rank is the rank-one class of its first weight plus the class of the remaining weights.
* `TauCeti.RegularFormClass.induction_on_rankOne`: every class is a sum of rank-one classes.
* `TauCeti.RegularFormClass.exists_eq_add_mk_rankOne` and
  `TauCeti.RegularFormClass.exists_eq_mk_binary_add`: a class of positive rank splits off a line,
  and one of rank at least two splits off a binary plane.

form `⟨w 0, …, w (n - 1)⟩`. The presented form is regular when `2` is invertible in `K`
(`TauCeti.nondegenerate_presentedForm`); in characteristic two its polar form vanishes, so it need
not be nondegenerate. -/
