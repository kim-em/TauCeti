# The diagram of a finite-type Cartan matrix is a forest

The elimination tools of `TauCeti.LinearAlgebra.RootSystem.FiniteType.Basic` are stated entrywise:
they say that certain patterns of nonzero entries cannot occur together. The classification of
finite-type Cartan matrices reads them as statements about a graph, the *diagram* of the matrix,
whose vertices are the indices and whose edges are the nonzero off-diagonal pairs. This file
introduces that graph and records the two global shape theorems the classification runs on: the
diagram of a finite-type matrix is **acyclic**, and every vertex of it has degree at most `3`. A
connected finite-type diagram is therefore a **tree**, with exactly one fewer edge than it has
vertices, and the Dynkin diagram of an irreducible root system is one such tree.

Acyclicity is the graph form of `TauCeti.IsFiniteType.exists_apply_succ_eq_zero`, whose statement is
about a cyclic list of indices; the list is supplied by Mathlib's characterization of acyclicity as
containing no copy of a cycle graph, `SimpleGraph.isAcyclic_iff_free_cycleGraph`. Connectedness in
the root-system case is irreducibility, which Mathlib packages as
`RootPairing.Base.induction_on_cartanMatrix`.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.diagramGraph`: the diagram of an integer matrix, a `SimpleGraph` on its index type,
  joining two distinct indices when the entries of the transposed pair are both nonzero.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.diagramGraph_submatrix`: the diagram of a principal submatrix is the pullback of the
  diagram along the reindexing.
* `TauCeti.DynkinType.diagramGraph_cartanMatrix_A`: the type `Aₙ` diagram is the path graph on
  `n` nodes.
* `TauCeti.IsFiniteType.isAcyclic_diagramGraph`: **the diagram of a finite-type matrix is a
  forest**. The affine diagrams `Ãₙ` for `n ≥ 2`, the ones whose diagrams are cycles, are excluded
  here in one theorem.
* `TauCeti.IsFiniteType.exists_chain_of_reachable`: two vertices in the same component are joined
  by a chain of distinct indices whose consecutive matrix entries are nonzero and whose
  nonconsecutive entries vanish. This is the bridge from graph paths to the principal-submatrix
  arguments used in the classification.
* `TauCeti.IsFiniteType.degree_le_three`: **the degree bound**, in graph form.
* `TauCeti.IsFiniteType.isTree_diagramGraph` and
  `TauCeti.IsFiniteType.card_edgeFinset_add_one_eq_card`: a connected finite-type diagram is a tree,
  and so has one fewer edge than it has vertices.
* `TauCeti.isTree_diagramGraph_cartanMatrix` and
  `TauCeti.card_edgeFinset_add_one_eq_card_support`: **the Dynkin diagram of an irreducible reduced
  crystallographic finite root system is a tree**, whose edges number one fewer than its simple
  roots. Connectedness is `TauCeti.preconnected_diagramGraph_cartanMatrix`.

/-- The **diagram** of an integer matrix: the graph on the index type joining two distinct indices
when both entries of the transposed pair are nonzero.

For a generalized Cartan matrix, and so for a matrix of finite type, one of the two entries is
nonzero exactly when the other is (`TauCeti.IsFiniteType.diagramGraph_adj_iff`), and the definition
is the expected one. Asking for both is what makes the relation symmetric for an arbitrary matrix,
where it is the diagram of the symmetrized vanishing pattern; the symmetrization that
`SimpleGraph.fromRel` performs is then a duplication, and `TauCeti.diagramGraph_adj` reads the
adjacency back off. -/

A cycle in a graph is a copy of a cycle graph of length at least three
(`SimpleGraph.isAcyclic_iff_free_cycleGraph`), so its vertices are a list of at least three distinct
indices each joined to its cyclic successor, which is what
`TauCeti.IsFiniteType.exists_apply_succ_eq_zero` forbids. -/

/-- **A reachable pair in a finite-type diagram is joined by an induced matrix chain.** More
precisely, there are vertices `w 0, ..., w n` with the prescribed endpoints, no repetitions,
nonzero entries between consecutive vertices, and zero entries between vertices separated by at
least one intermediate vertex.

The no-chord conclusion is the part not supplied merely by choosing a graph path. It follows from
the diagram being acyclic, and is what lets a classification argument identify the corresponding
principal submatrix with a chain-shaped model rather than only a matrix containing the chain's
edges. Nothing is asserted about vertices outside the chain. -/
