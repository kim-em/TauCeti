# Inversions of a Weyl-group element that preserves dominance

A Weyl-group element carrying a weight interior to the dominant chamber back into the closed
dominant chamber sends no positive root to a negative root, so its inversion set is empty. Since an
element with an empty inversion set is the identity, such an element is the identity: the Weyl
group acts freely on the interior of the dominant chamber.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.mapsTo_posRoots_of_smul_mem_dominantChamber`: such an element maps positive roots to
  positive roots.
* `TauCeti.inversions_eq_empty_of_smul_mem_dominantChamber` and
  `TauCeti.inversions_eq_empty_of_smul_eq_self`: its inversion set is empty.
* `TauCeti.eq_one_of_smul_mem_dominantChamber`: such an element is the identity.
* `TauCeti.eq_one_of_smul_eq_self_of_mem_openDominantChamber`: the Weyl group acts freely on the
  interior of the dominant chamber.

## References

This file proves the interior case of the uniqueness half of the fundamental-domain item of Layer 4
in `TauCetiRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/RootSystems/README.md`: for a weight interior to the
dominant chamber the moving element is forced to be the identity, and the Weyl group acts freely
there. The general case, where a weight on a wall of the chamber is fixed by the reflection in that
wall and the moving element need not be the identity, is
`TauCeti/LinearAlgebra/RootSystem/FundamentalDomain.lean`. The proof rests on the chamber
definitions in `TauCeti/LinearAlgebra/RootSystem/Chamber.lean` and the identity criterion for
inversion sets in `TauCeti/LinearAlgebra/RootSystem/Inversions/StrongExchange.lean`. The argument
is the one in J. E. Humphreys, *Introduction to Lie Algebras and Representation Theory*, GTM 9,
Ch. III, §10.
