# Long and short simple roots of a Dynkin type

A Cartan matrix records more than an unoriented diagram: the ratio of a transposed pair of its
off-diagonal entries is the ratio of the squared lengths of the two simple roots. This file reads
that information off the standard Cartan matrices of `TauCeti.DynkinType`, pinning for each type
which of its nodes carry long simple roots and which carry short ones, and then proves that the
reading is correct against Mathlib's `RootPairing.RootPositiveForm.rootLength`.

Two pieces of data are attached to a type, both read off family by family.
`TauCeti.DynkinType.rootLength` gives the relative squared length of each simple root, normalised
for a *valid* type so that a shortest one has length `1`; it symmetrises the standard Cartan matrix
*on the right*, `A i j * ℓ j = A j i * ℓ i`, so it is integral where the symmetriser `d` asked for
by `TauCeti.IsFiniteType`, which scales the matrix on the left, is rational: that one is the
reciprocal `d i = (ℓ i)⁻¹`. `TauCeti.DynkinType.IsLongSimpleRoot` then singles out the long nodes.
Away from the degenerate `B 1` those are exactly the nodes of maximal length
(`TauCeti.DynkinType.isLongSimpleRoot_iff`), in particular for a valid type.

A handful of degenerate types stand between the family-wise reading and its intended meaning, and
each of the four statements below that meets one is proved first in its exact form, naming the
types it excludes, and then specialised to a valid type for the downstream consumers, which reach a
type through `TauCeti.HasCartanType` and so have validity and nothing else. The sole node of `C 1`
is the last node of the `Cₙ` family, hence long, of length `2`: nothing shorter sits beside it to
normalise against, so `rootLength` is off by the factor `2` there. The sole node of `B 1` is the
last node of the `Bₙ` family, hence short, while being of maximal length for want of competition:
that is the one type where the family-wise reading and the maximality reading of
`IsLongSimpleRoot` part company. Finally the rank-zero types `A 0`, `B 0`, `C 0` and `D 0` have no
node at all. A statement quantified over the nodes cannot see that, but an existential one can.

## The Bourbaki numbering

Everything here is stated against the node numbering of `TauCeti.DynkinType.cartanMatrix`, which is
Bourbaki's with node `i` at `Fin` index `i - 1`. Zero-based `Fin` indices against one-based
Bourbaki labels are the standing trap, so the numbering is pinned explicitly: the `Aₙ` chain runs
`0, 1, …, n - 1` in order; `Bₙ` and `Cₙ` continue that chain with the double edge between `n - 2`
and `n - 1`, the short simple root being the last node of `Bₙ` and the long one the last node of
`Cₙ`; `Dₙ` forks at `n - 3`; `Eₙ` follows Bourbaki with index `1` the branch node; `F₄` has
`0, 1` long and `2, 3` short; and `G₂` is short then long, so `TauCeti.DynkinType.IsLongSimpleRoot`
selects index `1` there.

`G₂` is the one place where Mathlib's convention differs from Bourbaki's, and
`TauCeti.DynkinType.cartanMatrix` follows Bourbaki: Mathlib's `CartanMatrix.G₂ = !![2, -3; -1, 2]`
is documented as the transpose of Bourbaki's plate IX matrix, so the standard matrix pinned here is
`CartanMatrix.G₂ᵀ = !![2, -1; -3, 2]`, whose short simple root comes first. That orientation is
what `TauCeti.DynkinType.cartanMatrix_mul_rootLength` forces: reading the lengths off the
transposed matrix instead would make that identity false.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.DynkinType.rootLength`: the relative squared length of each simple root of a type.
* `TauCeti.DynkinType.IsLongSimpleRoot`: the nodes its family calls long, which for a valid type
  are exactly those carrying a simple root of maximal length.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.DynkinType.cartanMatrix_mul_rootLength`: the standard Cartan matrix of a type is
  symmetrised on the right by `rootLength`, that is `A i j * ℓ j = A j i * ℓ i`. This is the
  identity that pins the relative lengths, and it holds for every type, valid or not.
* `TauCeti.DynkinType.exists_rootLength_eq_one_iff`: a type has a simple root of length `1` exactly
  when it has a node at all and is not `C 1`, whose sole node has length `2`; with
  `TauCeti.DynkinType.rootLength_pos` this is the normalisation of the lengths.
  `TauCeti.DynkinType.exists_rootLength_eq_one` is the corollary for a valid type.
* `TauCeti.DynkinType.isLongSimpleRoot_iff`: outside the degenerate `B 1`, a node is long exactly
  when its simple root has maximal length; `B 1` has a single node, which is of maximal length
  while `IsLongSimpleRoot` calls it short, because it is the short node of the `Bₙ` family.
  `TauCeti.DynkinType.isLongSimpleRoot_iff_of_valid` is the corollary for a valid type.
* `TauCeti.DynkinType.forall_isLongSimpleRoot_iff`: a type has all its simple roots long exactly
  when it is simply laced, has no node at all, or is `C 1`; for a valid type this is
  `TauCeti.DynkinType.forall_isLongSimpleRoot_iff_isSimplyLaced`.
* `TauCeti.DynkinType.exists_isLongSimpleRoot_iff`: a type has a long simple root exactly when it
  has a node at all and is not `B 1`; `TauCeti.DynkinType.exists_isLongSimpleRoot` is the corollary
  for a valid type.
* `TauCeti.DynkinType.isLongSimpleRoot_congr`: the predicate transports along an equality of
  diagrams.
* `TauCeti.DynkinType.isLongSimpleRoot_C_iff_not_isLongSimpleRoot_B`: `Bₙ` and `Cₙ` carry the same
  diagram with the lengths exchanged.
* `RootPairing.RootPositiveForm.rootLength_le_iff_pairingIn_le`: in any root pairing
  carrying a root-positive form, two roots meeting at a strictly negative pairing compare in length
  exactly as the transposed pair of pairings compares. This is the statement that makes the
  Cartan-matrix reading above meaningful.
* `RootPairing.RootPositiveForm.rootLength_le_iff_dynkinRootLength_le`: for a base matched
  to a Dynkin type, adjacent simple roots compare in length exactly as
  `TauCeti.DynkinType.rootLength` says they do.

/-- The relative squared length of the simple roots of a Dynkin type, in the Bourbaki numbering of
`TauCeti.DynkinType.cartanMatrix`, given family by family and normalised, for a valid type, so that
a shortest simple root has length `1`.

"Length" is squared length, as in Mathlib's `RootPairing.RootPositiveForm.rootLength`: it is the
value of an invariant form on a root with itself. The vector symmetrises the standard Cartan matrix
on the right (`TauCeti.DynkinType.cartanMatrix_mul_rootLength`), the symmetriser `d` that scales it
on the left, as in `TauCeti.IsFiniteType`, being the reciprocal `d i = (ℓ i)⁻¹`. Either way the
matrix alone determines the vector up to a positive factor once the diagram is connected; the
normalisation fixes that factor.

Validity is what the normalisation needs, and among the types of positive rank `C 1` is the one
that lacks it (the rank-zero types have no node to normalise against): its sole node is
the last node of the `Cₙ` family, hence of length `2`, with no shorter node beside it, so every
length there is twice what the normalisation would ask. Fixing that by hand would cost a
special case in `rootLength` and in every proof reading it, to normalise a type that
`TauCeti.DynkinType.Valid` excludes anyway; the family-wise reading is kept instead. -/

Writing `A = t.cartanMatrix` and `ℓ = t.rootLength`, the products `A i j * ℓ j` are symmetric in
`i` and `j`, so `ℓ i / ℓ j = A i j / A j i` whenever the two nodes are joined. This is what fixes
the relative lengths, and with `TauCeti.DynkinType.rootLength_pos` it exhibits the rational
symmetriser `d i = (ℓ i)⁻¹` that `TauCeti.IsFiniteType` asks for, which scales the matrix on the
left rather than on the right as `ℓ` does.

/-- A simple root of a Dynkin type is **long** when its type's family calls that node long, in the
Bourbaki numbering of `TauCeti.DynkinType.cartanMatrix`: simply-laced types have all their simple
roots of the same length, hence all long; `Bₙ` is short at its last node, `Cₙ` long only at its
last node, `F₄` long at its first two nodes and `G₂` long at its second, following Bourbaki's
numbering as `TauCeti.DynkinType.cartanMatrix` pins it.

Away from the degenerate `B 1` this is exactly maximality of length among the simple roots
(`TauCeti.DynkinType.isLongSimpleRoot_iff`), in particular for a valid type
(`TauCeti.DynkinType.isLongSimpleRoot_iff_of_valid`). `B 1` really is an exception: it has a single
node, of maximal length, that this predicate calls short as the short node of the `Bₙ` family. -/

`a * y = c * x` with `x` positive and `a` strictly negative, then `x ≤ y` exactly when `c ≤ a`.

This is the shared arithmetic behind the two length comparisons below: a transposed pair of Cartan

are those of `TauCeti.DynkinType.rootLength` or those measured by a root-positive form. -/

/-- **Two roots meeting at a strictly negative pairing compare in length exactly as their
transposed pair of pairings compares.** This is the content behind reading root lengths off a
Cartan matrix: `⟨αᵢ, αⱼ^∨⟩ / ⟨αⱼ, αᵢ^∨⟩` is the ratio `‖αᵢ‖² / ‖αⱼ‖²`, so the more negative entry
belongs to the longer root.

The negativity hypothesis is what pins the direction. It is automatic for two distinct simple roots
of a base, whose pairings are nonpositive, once they are not orthogonal; for a pair with positive
pairings the comparison is reversed. -/

/-- **A base matched to a Dynkin type has its adjacent simple roots comparing in length exactly as
`TauCeti.DynkinType.rootLength` says.** The matching `e` is taken as data rather than through
`TauCeti.HasCartanType` so that the statement names the node the comparison is made at; any witness
of `TauCeti.HasCartanType` supplies one, and since the left-hand side does not mention `e`, the
comparison read off the type is the same for every witness.

The hypothesis that the two nodes are joined is necessary: two simple roots that are orthogonal are
constrained by nothing, and in `Cₙ` for instance the first node is short although no neighbour of
it is longer. -/
