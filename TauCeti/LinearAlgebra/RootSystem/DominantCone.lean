# The weight cone below a weight is finite once it is stable under the simple reflections

Fix a base `b` of a finite crystallographic root system `P` and a weight `lam`. The set of weights
lying **below** `lam`, that is those `mu` with `lam - mu` in the positive root cone `Q⁺`, is
infinite: it is a whole translated cone. This file proves that two further conditions cut it down
to a finite set.

* **Dominance.** Only finitely many `mu` below `lam` take a natural value on every simple coroot
  (`TauCeti.finite_setOf_dominant_sub_mem_posRootCone`). This is the classical statement that a
  dominant weight below `lam` is bounded, and it comes straight from positive definiteness of the
  symmetrized Cartan matrix, in the form given in
  `TauCeti/LinearAlgebra/RootSystem/FiniteType/Bounded.lean`.
* **Stability under the simple reflections.** A set of weights below `lam` on which every simple
  coroot takes integer values and which is carried into itself by every simple reflection is
  finite (`TauCeti.finite_of_forall_reflection_mem_of_sub_mem_posRootCone`). Stability replaces
  dominance: a non-dominant member is raised by a simple reflection to another member strictly
  closer to `lam`, so it is a Weyl translate of a dominant member, and the Weyl group is finite.

The second statement is the shape the representation theory needs. The weights of an irreducible
highest weight module of dominant integral highest weight `lam` lie in `lam - Q⁺`, take integer
values on the simple coroots and are stable under the simple reflections, none of which presupposes
that the module is finite-dimensional; the theorem below turns those three facts into finiteness of
the weight support.

The raising step is itself worth naming, because a Weyl translate carries more information than a
cardinality: under the same three hypotheses every member has a Weyl-group element taking it to a
dominant member of the set
(`TauCeti.exists_weylGroup_smul_dominant_of_forall_reflection_mem_of_sub_mem_posRootCone`).
Finiteness is the corollary obtained by forgetting which translate was used.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.finite_setOf_dominant_sub_mem_posRootCone`: **only finitely many dominant weights lie
  below a given weight.**
* `TauCeti.exists_weylGroup_smul_dominant_of_forall_reflection_mem_of_sub_mem_posRootCone`: **a
  member of a set of weights below `lam`, integral on the simple coroots and stable under the
  simple reflections, has a dominant Weyl translate in the set.**
* `TauCeti.finite_of_forall_reflection_mem_of_sub_mem_posRootCone`: **a set of weights below `lam`,
  integral on the simple coroots and stable under the simple reflections, is finite.**
* `TauCeti.eq_zero_of_mem_posRootCone_of_forall_coroot'_nonpos`: **the only antidominant member of
  the positive root cone is zero**, the case `lam = 0` of the first statement applied to all the
  natural multiples of a member at once.

## The argument

Writing `lam - mu = ∑ j, c j • αⱼ` with natural coefficients `c j`, the value of `mu` on the simple
coroot `αᵢ^∨` is `lam (αᵢ^∨) - ∑ j, c j * ⟨αⱼ, αᵢ^∨⟩`. Dominance therefore says that the natural
vector `c` solves the Cartan inequality of the transposed Cartan matrix, whose solution set is
finite; the right-hand side of the inequality is manufactured from one member of the set, which is
why the argument begins by disposing of the empty case.

For the other two, if `mu` is a member on which `αᵢ^∨` takes a negative value, then
`sᵢ mu = mu - ⟨mu, αᵢ^∨⟩ αᵢ` is again a member and `lam - sᵢ mu` has strictly smaller height: the
simple roots are linearly independent, so the coefficient vectors of the two differences agree
except at `i`, where the coefficient drops by `-⟨mu, αᵢ^∨⟩ ≥ 1`. Induction on that height therefore
writes every member as a Weyl translate of a dominant member, which is the second statement;
finiteness follows because both the dominant members and the Weyl group are finite.

/-- **Only finitely many dominant weights lie below a given weight.** For a base `b` of a finite
crystallographic root system and a weight `lam`, only finitely many `mu` satisfy both that
`lam - mu` is a nonnegative integer combination of the simple roots and that every simple coroot
takes a natural value on `mu`.

The two hypotheses pull in opposite directions: the first writes `lam - mu` as `∑ j, c j • αⱼ` with
`c j` natural, and the second bounds the resulting Cartan expression `∑ j, c j ⟨αⱼ, αᵢ^∨⟩` above.
Positive definiteness of the symmetrized Cartan matrix
(`TauCeti.finite_setOf_forall_sum_mul_le`) leaves only finitely many such `c`. -/

/-- **A member of a reflection-stable set of weights below a weight has a dominant Weyl
translate in the set.** Let `S` be a set of weights with `lam - mu` in the positive root cone for
every `mu ∈ S`, on which every simple coroot takes integer values, and which every simple
reflection carries into itself. Then every `mu ∈ S` has a Weyl-group element `w` for which `w • mu`
again lies in `S` and every simple coroot takes a natural value on it.

A member on which some simple coroot is negative is moved by the corresponding reflection strictly
closer to `lam`, so the induction on the height of `lam - mu` stops exactly at a dominant member;
the set of weights admitting such a `w` is reflection stable, which is what lets the induction run
inside it.

`RootPairing.exists_mem_dominantChamber` is the same statement for an arbitrary weight, with
dominance read as `0 ≤ ⟨mu, αᵢ^∨⟩` and no reference to `lam`. It needs a `[LinearOrder R]` on the
coefficient ring, which is exactly what the weight space of a Lie algebra over an algebraically
closed field does not carry. Here dominance is instead the order-free condition that each
`⟨mu, αᵢ^∨⟩` is a natural number, which the hypotheses on `S` make available, and the cone below
`lam` replaces the maximization argument. -/
