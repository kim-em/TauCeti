# The Weyl numerator

The Weyl character formula is an identity in the integral group algebra `ℤ[M]` of the weight space
of a root pairing, between the formal character of an irreducible module and two universal
elements of that algebra: the Weyl numerator `N(λ)` and the Weyl denominator `Δ`. As soon as there
is a positive root, `Δ` is not invertible in `ℤ[M]` — it then augments to `0`, whereas a unit
augments to `±1` — so the formula is read there in the cross-multiplied form
`ch L(λ) · Δ = N(λ)`, the familiar quotient `N(λ) / Δ` living in a localization where `Δ` becomes
invertible. This file builds the **Weyl numerator**
`N(λ) = ∑_{w ∈ W} sgn(w) e^{w ⬝ λ}`, the alternating sum over the *dot* orbit of `λ`, and its
combinatorics, with no Lie algebra in sight. The denominator `Δ = ∏_{α > 0} (1 - e^{-α})` is
`TauCeti.weylDenominator`, which needs far less and lives in its own earlier file.

Writing the numerator through the dot action `w ⬝ λ = w(λ + ρ) - ρ` (`TauCeti.dotAction`) rather
than as `∑ sgn(w) e^{w(λ+ρ)}` is what keeps every exponent inside the weight lattice, matching the
normalization `∏_{α>0}(1 - e^{-α})` of the denominator rather than the symmetric one
`∏_{α>0}(e^{α/2} - e^{-α/2})`, which needs half-roots. The two normalizations differ by the factor
`e^{ρ}`.

The signs come from `TauCeti.weylSign`, the character `w ↦ (-1)^{ℓ(w)}` of the Weyl group; they
are what makes the numerator *alternating*, which is the content of
`TauCeti.weylNumerator_dotAction` and of everything derived from it.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.weylNumerator`: `N(λ) = ∑_{w ∈ W} sgn(w) e^{w ⬝ λ}`, an element of `ℤ[M]`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.weylNumerator_dotAction`: **the numerator is alternating**, `N(v ⬝ λ) = sgn(v) · N(λ)`;
  `TauCeti.coeff_weylNumerator_dotAction` is the corresponding coefficient transformation rule.
* `TauCeti.weylNumerator_eq_zero_of_dotAction_eq_self`: a weight fixed by an odd element of the
  Weyl group has vanishing numerator, and `TauCeti.weylNumerator_eq_zero_of_coroot'_eq_neg_one`:
  so does a weight on a wall `⟨λ, αᵢ^∨⟩ = -1` of a simple reflection for the dot action, which is
  the case the highest-weight theory meets.
* `TauCeti.coeff_weylNumerator_dotAction_of_injective`,
  `TauCeti.support_coeff_weylNumerator_of_injective`,
  `TauCeti.card_support_coeff_weylNumerator_of_injective` and
  `TauCeti.weylNumerator_ne_zero_of_injective`: when the dot orbit map `w ↦ w ⬝ λ` is injective the
  `|W|` terms sit at `|W|` distinct weights, so the coefficient at `w ⬝ λ` is `sgn(w)`, the support
  is exactly the dot orbit and has `|W|` elements, and the numerator does not vanish. A **dominant**
  weight has an injective dot orbit map by
  `TauCeti.dotAction_eq_dotAction_iff_of_mem_dominantChamber`, whence
  `TauCeti.support_coeff_weylNumerator`, `TauCeti.card_support_coeff_weylNumerator` and
  `TauCeti.weylNumerator_ne_zero_of_mem_dominantChamber`.

## Implementation notes

`TauCeti.weylNumerator` sums over `Finset.univ` and so carries `[Fintype P.weylGroup]` rather than
`[Finite P.weylGroup]`. The Weyl group of a finite root system is finite
(`RootPairing.finite_weylGroup`), and a consumer holding only that instance
supplies the `Fintype` with `Fintype.ofFinite`; the value of the sum does not depend on which one,
since `Fintype` is a subsingleton.

The freeness statements are proved from the injectivity of the dot orbit map, which is all they
use; dominance enters only through the corollaries of the last section, which is also the only
place the ordered hypotheses appear. Those hypotheses already supply `IsDomain R` through
`IsStrictOrderedRing.isDomain`, so it is not repeated there.

## References

This builds the `weylNumerator` target of
`TauCetiRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/LieHighestWeight/README.md`, Layer 6 ("the character,
dimension, and Kostant formulas"), whose `Suggested.lean` pins it on `Module.Dual K H` for the root
system of a Cartan subalgebra. As with `TauCeti.weylVector` and `TauCeti.dotAction`, the
combinatorics lives at the level of an abstract root pairing, so the Lie-algebra target is a
specialization rather than a rebuild.

/-! ### Weights with a free dot orbit

Nothing below asks for more than the injectivity of the dot orbit map `w ↦ w ⬝ λ`: it makes the
`|W|` terms of the numerator sit at `|W|` distinct weights, so none of them cancels. A dominant
weight is the case of interest, and is treated in the last section.

/-- **The coefficients of the numerator along a free dot orbit are the signs.** No two Weyl-group
elements carry `λ` to the same place, so the term of `w` sits alone at `w ⬝ λ`. -/

/-! ### Dominant weights

For a dominant weight the dot action is free
(`TauCeti.eq_one_of_dotAction_eq_self_of_mem_dominantChamber`), so the results of the previous
section apply verbatim. The linearly ordered hypotheses of this section already supply
`IsDomain R` through `IsStrictOrderedRing.isDomain`, so it is not repeated.
