# The Weyl vector of a base

The **Weyl vector** `ρ` of a base of a root pairing is the half-sum of the positive roots. It is
the shift that turns the Weyl group action on weights into the dot action, and it appears in the
Weyl character, dimension and Kostant formulas as the correction `λ ↦ λ + ρ`.

Which roots are positive is defined only over a coefficient ring of characteristic zero, and
halving asks for `2` to be invertible on top of that. So the sum of the positive roots is
introduced first, as `TauCeti.twoWeylVector`, over a characteristic-zero coefficient ring, and the
Weyl vector itself only once `2` is invertible as well. The simple-coroot pairing and the simple
reflection identity are proved for the sum first and then divided by two; the statements that
speak of `ρ` alone — the dot action and the dominance results — are proved only in the halved
form. So nothing below assumes more of the coefficient ring than its own statement needs.

The one theorem the notion exists for is that `ρ` pairs to `1` with every simple coroot,
equivalently that the simple reflection `sᵢ` sends `ρ` to `ρ - αᵢ`. Its proof is the classical
one: `sᵢ` negates `αᵢ` and permutes the remaining positive roots, so the pairings of those
remaining roots with `αᵢ^∨` cancel in pairs and only `⟨αᵢ, αᵢ^∨⟩ = 2` survives.

Those values on the simple coroots determine the values on all of them, and the answer is the
**height** of the coroot: expanding `α^∨` in the simple coroots and pairing termwise gives
`⟨ρ, α^∨⟩ = ht(α^∨)`, the sum of the coefficients. Two consequences of that identity are recorded
below. First, `⟨ρ, α^∨⟩` is never zero, because no root has height zero — so `ρ` is a **regular**
weight, with no order on the coefficient ring needed. Over a linearly ordered ring that already
follows from strict dominance, but a root system attached to a Lie algebra over an algebraically
closed field carries no order, and it is there that the Weyl dimension formula needs its
denominators `⟨ρ, α^∨⟩` to be invertible. Second, where there *is* an order, the pairing with a
positive coroot is not merely positive but at least `1`, being a positive integer.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.twoWeylVector`: the sum of the positive roots, that is `2ρ`.
* `TauCeti.weylVector`: the Weyl vector `ρ`, the half-sum of the positive roots, defined when `2`
  is invertible in the coefficient ring.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.coroot'_twoWeylVector` and `TauCeti.coroot'_weylVector`: `⟨2ρ, αᵢ^∨⟩ = 2` and
  `⟨ρ, αᵢ^∨⟩ = 1` for every simple root `αᵢ`.
* `TauCeti.reflection_twoWeylVector` and `TauCeti.reflection_weylVector`: `sᵢ(2ρ) = 2ρ - 2αᵢ` and
  `sᵢ(ρ) = ρ - αᵢ`.
* `TauCeti.sum_root_negRootsFinset`: the sum of the negative roots is `-2ρ`.
* `TauCeti.coroot'_twoWeylVector_eq_two_mul_height_flip` and
  `TauCeti.coroot'_weylVector_eq_height_flip`: `⟨2ρ, α^∨⟩ = 2 ht(α^∨)` and `⟨ρ, α^∨⟩ = ht(α^∨)` for
  an arbitrary root `α`, the general form of the two preceding identities.
* `TauCeti.isRegularWeight_twoWeylVector` and `TauCeti.isRegularWeight_weylVector`: `2ρ` and `ρ`
  are regular weights, needing no order on the coefficient ring, with
  `TauCeti.coroot'_twoWeylVector_ne_zero` and `TauCeti.coroot'_weylVector_ne_zero` the pairings
  that witness it and `TauCeti.twoWeylVector_ne_zero`, `TauCeti.weylVector_ne_zero` the resulting
  nonvanishing.
* `TauCeti.reflection_add_weylVector_sub_weylVector`: the dot action of a simple reflection,
  `sᵢ ⬝ λ = λ - (⟨λ, αᵢ^∨⟩ + 1) αᵢ`.
* `TauCeti.add_weylVector_mem_openDominantChamber` and
  `TauCeti.weylVector_mem_openDominantChamber`: over a linearly ordered coefficient ring the
  `ρ`-shift of a dominant weight is strictly dominant, and `ρ` itself is a regular weight.
* `TauCeti.openDominantChamber_nonempty`: consequently the open dominant chamber has a point,
  which over a general coefficient ring is a genuine hypothesis rather than a formality.
* `TauCeti.one_le_coroot'_weylVector_of_mem_posRoots` and
  `TauCeti.coroot'_weylVector_le_neg_one_of_mem_negRoots`: over a linearly ordered coefficient ring
  `⟨ρ, α^∨⟩ ≥ 1` for a positive root and `≤ -1` for a negative one.

## References

This file supplies the root-pairing-level prerequisite of the Weyl vector of the highest-weight
theory: the nonvanishing and integrality of `⟨ρ, α^∨⟩` proved below are what makes the denominator
of the Weyl dimension formula `dim L(λ) = ∏_{α>0} ⟨λ+ρ, α^∨⟩ / ⟨ρ, α^∨⟩` meaningful. Nothing here
is a Lie-algebra-level declaration: `ρ` is built for an abstract root pairing, where the
positive-root combinatorics it needs already lives, so that the Lie-algebra version is a
specialization rather than a rebuild.

The argument is the one in J. E. Humphreys, *Introduction to Lie Algebras and Representation
Theory*, GTM 9, Ch. III, §10.2 and §13.3.
