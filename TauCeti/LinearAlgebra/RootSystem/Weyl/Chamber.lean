# The Weyl chambers of a base

The dominant chamber of a base is one of a family: its translates under the Weyl group are the
**Weyl chambers**. This file introduces them, in both the closed and the open form, and proves
that the Weyl group permutes them **simply transitively**.

Two facts drive everything. A weight interior to the dominant chamber is moved by every
nontrivial Weyl-group element, indeed out of the closed dominant chamber
(`TauCeti.eq_one_of_smul_mem_dominantChamber`); and every weight is Weyl-conjugate into the closed
dominant chamber (`RootPairing.exists_mem_dominantChamber`). The first says an open chamber meets
the closed chamber of no other Weyl-group element, so the labelling `w ↦ w • openDominantChamber` is
injective as soon as the open dominant chamber has a point to distinguish two labels by; the set of
open chambers is by definition the range of that labelling, so surjectivity is free, and the two
together make it a bijection from the Weyl group onto the set of open chambers, which is what simple
transitivity means here. The second fact is what covers the weights: it is how every *regular*
weight is shown to lie in an open chamber.

The weights lying in an open chamber are exactly the **regular** ones
(`RootPairing.IsRegularWeight`), those killed by no coroot functional. That is the sense in
which the open chambers are the complement of the walls:
`TauCeti.iUnion_openWeylChamber_eq_setOf_isRegularWeight` identifies their union with the regular
weights, and `TauCeti.existsUnique_mem_openWeylChamber` puts each regular weight in exactly one of
them.

Unlike the uniqueness statements, the bijection needs the open dominant chamber to be *nonempty*,
which is a genuine hypothesis rather than a formality: the open chambers are cut out by strict
inequalities, and over a coefficient ring where `2` is not invertible a base may have no strictly
dominant weight to offer. So it is carried as an explicit argument, and
`TauCeti.openDominantChamber_nonempty` discharges it whenever `2` is invertible, the Weyl vector
`ρ` being strictly dominant there.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.weylChamber` and `TauCeti.openWeylChamber`: the Weyl translates of the closed and the
  open dominant chamber.
* `TauCeti.openWeylChambers`: the set of open Weyl chambers of a base, carrying the Weyl-group
  action restricted from the pointwise action on `Set M`.
* `TauCeti.weylGroupEquivOpenWeylChambers`: the Weyl group as an index set for the open chambers.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.mem_weylChamber_iff` and `TauCeti.mem_openWeylChamber_iff`: the chamber of `w` is the
  sign-pattern cone of the coroot functionals of the roots `w(αᵢ)`.
* `TauCeti.eq_of_mem_openWeylChamber_of_mem_weylChamber`: an open chamber meets the closed chamber
  of no other Weyl-group element; hence `TauCeti.pairwise_disjoint_openWeylChamber`.
* `TauCeti.openWeylChamber_injective`, `TauCeti.stabilizer_openWeylChamber_eq_bot` and
  `TauCeti.openWeylChambers.stabilizer_eq_bot`: the Weyl group acts freely on the open chambers.
* `TauCeti.exists_smul_eq_of_mem_openWeylChambers` and the `MulAction.IsPretransitive` instance on
  `TauCeti.openWeylChambers`: the Weyl group acts transitively on the open chambers.
* `TauCeti.iUnion_openWeylChamber_eq_setOf_isRegularWeight` and
  `TauCeti.existsUnique_mem_openWeylChamber`: the open chambers partition the regular weights.

## Implementation notes

Chambers are indexed by Weyl-group elements rather than cut out one at a time by a sign pattern,
because that is the form simple transitivity takes: the content of the theorem is that the
indexing is injective. The sign-pattern description is recovered as
`TauCeti.mem_openWeylChamber_iff`. Both readings of "acts simply transitively" are available: the
labelling bijection `TauCeti.weylGroupEquivOpenWeylChambers`, and the transitive free action on
the type `TauCeti.openWeylChambers P b`.

The covering statements are proved as `..._of_finite_weylGroup`, which asks only that the Weyl
group be finite, and the root-system forms are read off from those using
`RootPairing.finite_weylGroup`; this follows the shape of
`RootPairing.exists_mem_dominantChamber_of_finite_weylGroup`, which is what they consume.

Existence of a dominant representative is `RootPairing.exists_mem_dominantChamber`; for an
interior dominant weight, `TauCeti.eq_one_of_smul_mem_dominantChamber` gives uniqueness and a
trivial stabilizer. Together these yield simple transitivity on the nonempty open chambers.
