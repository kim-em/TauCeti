# The Weyl denominator identity

The **Weyl denominator identity** is the equality

`∏_{α > 0} (1 - e^{-α}) = ∑_{w ∈ W} sgn(w) e^{w ⬝ 0}`

in the integral group algebra `ℤ[M]` of the weight space of a root system: the Weyl denominator
`TauCeti.weylDenominator` is the Weyl numerator `TauCeti.weylNumerator` of the weight `0`. Written
without the dot action `w ⬝ 0 = w(ρ) - ρ` it is the familiar
`∏_{α>0}(1 - e^{-α}) = ∑_w sgn(w) e^{w(ρ) - ρ}`, or, after multiplying by `e^{ρ}`, the symmetric
form `∏_{α>0}(e^{α/2} - e^{-α/2}) = ∑_w sgn(w) e^{w(ρ)}`.

It is the case `λ = 0` of the Weyl character formula, which identifies the product of a formal
character with the denominator with the numerator of a dominant weight. Thus the identity is proved
first and on its own, with no representation theory involved.

## The argument

`Δ` is alternating for the dot action (`TauCeti.isDotAlternating_weylDenominator`), so
`TauCeti.IsDotAlternating.eq_weylNumerator` reduces the identity to two coefficient computations on
the open chamber of the dot action: the constant term of `Δ` is `1`
(`TauCeti.coeff_weylDenominator_zero`, an elementary expansion proved with the denominator itself),
and `0` is the only weight of that chamber where `Δ` does not vanish.

The second computation is the geometric heart of the identity, and is the only step specific to the
denominator. An exponent of `Δ` is `-ν` for a sum `ν` of positive roots; lying in the open dot
chamber makes `ρ - ν` strictly dominant, which bounds every `⟨ν, αᵢ^∨⟩` above by `1`; these
pairings are integers, hence nonpositive; and the only antidominant member of the positive root
cone is `0` (`TauCeti.eq_zero_of_mem_posRootCone_of_forall_coroot'_nonpos`).

## The coefficient ring

Everything below is stated over a linearly ordered coefficient ring, which is where the chamber
geometry the proof runs through lives: `TauCeti.openDotDominantChamber` is defined through
`RootPairing.openDominantChamber`, whose orbit-existence theorem asks for `[LinearOrder R]`, and
`TauCeti.IsDotAlternating.eq_weylNumerator` is stated over an ordered ring. The identity therefore
specializes directly to an ordered root pairing — a rational or a real one — but not, without a
base change, to one over an unordered field such as `ℂ`. Carrying it there is a scalar-restriction
question about `RootPairing.restrictScalars'`, which produces a pairing on the span of the roots
rather than on the ambient weight module, and is not attempted here.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.weylDenominator_eq_weylNumerator_zero`: **the Weyl denominator identity**, `Δ = N(0)`.
* `TauCeti.support_coeff_weylDenominator` and `TauCeti.card_support_coeff_weylDenominator`:
  consequently `Δ` is supported on the dot orbit of `0` and has exactly `|W|` terms.
