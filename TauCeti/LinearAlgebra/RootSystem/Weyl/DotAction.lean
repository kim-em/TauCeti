# The dot action of the Weyl group on weights

The **dot action** of the Weyl group of a base is the linear action conjugated by the translation
by the Weyl vector `ρ`:
`w ⬝ x = w (x + ρ) - ρ`.
It is the action that the highest-weight theory runs on, because it is the linear action recentred
at the point `-ρ` rather than at the origin: `-ρ` is its fixed point
(`TauCeti.dotAction_neg_weylVector`), and a simple reflection acts by
`sᵢ ⬝ x = x - (⟨x, αᵢ^∨⟩ + 1) αᵢ`, so its wall is `⟨x, αᵢ^∨⟩ = -1` instead of `⟨x, αᵢ^∨⟩ = 0`.

Everything about it is a transport of the linear theory along the bijection `x ↦ x + ρ`, and that
is how this file is organized: `TauCeti.dotAction_add_weylVector` is the equivariance of the shift,
and every later statement is read off from a linear one through it. The one place where the dot
action is genuinely better behaved than the linear action is the closed dominant chamber. The
linear action is free only on the *interior* of the chamber — a weight on a wall is fixed by the
reflection in that wall — whereas the dot action is free on the whole closed chamber
(`TauCeti.eq_one_of_dotAction_eq_self_of_mem_dominantChamber`), because the `ρ`-shift of a dominant
weight is strictly dominant. That freeness is the separation statement the highest-weight theory
needs: distinct dominant weights lie in distinct dot orbits.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.dotAction`: the dot action `w ⬝ x = w (x + ρ) - ρ` of a Weyl-group element on a weight.
* `TauCeti.dotActionPerm`: the same, packaged as a group homomorphism into `Equiv.Perm M`. The dot
  action is not registered as a `MulAction` instance, since the weight space already carries the
  linear action of the Weyl group.
* `TauCeti.openDotDominantChamber`: the open dominant chamber of the dot action, the weights whose
  `ρ`-shift is strictly dominant, equivalently those with `-1 < ⟨x, αᵢ^∨⟩` for every simple root.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.dotAction_add_weylVector`: `w ⬝ x + ρ = w (x + ρ)`, the equivariance of the `ρ`-shift,
  from which the action laws `TauCeti.dotAction_one` and `TauCeti.dotAction_mul` follow.
* `TauCeti.dotAction_ofIdx`: a simple reflection acts by `sᵢ ⬝ x = x - (⟨x, αᵢ^∨⟩ + 1) αᵢ`, and
  `TauCeti.coroot'_dotAction_ofIdx`: it sends the pairing `⟨x, αᵢ^∨⟩` to `-⟨x, αᵢ^∨⟩ - 2`.
* `TauCeti.dotAction_ofIdx_eq_self_iff`: the wall of `sᵢ` for the dot action is `⟨x, αᵢ^∨⟩ = -1`.
* `TauCeti.eq_one_of_dotAction_eq_self_of_mem_openDotDominantChamber`,
  `TauCeti.eq_of_dotAction_eq_of_mem_openDotDominantChamber` and
  `TauCeti.dotAction_injective_of_mem_openDotDominantChamber`: **the dot action is free on its own
  open dominant chamber**, which for a general coefficient ring may be strictly larger than the
  closed dominant chamber.
* `TauCeti.eq_one_of_dotAction_mem_dominantChamber` and
  `TauCeti.eq_one_of_dotAction_eq_self_of_mem_dominantChamber`: **the dot action is free on the
  closed dominant chamber**, and no nontrivial element keeps a dominant weight dominant.
* `TauCeti.eq_of_dotAction_eq_of_mem_dominantChamber` and
  `TauCeti.dotAction_eq_dotAction_iff_of_mem_dominantChamber`: **a dominant weight is the only
  dominant weight in its dot orbit**, and it is reached by a unique Weyl-group element.

## Implementation notes

The dot action is deliberately *not* a `MulAction` instance on `M`: the weight space already
carries the linear action of `P.weylGroup`, and a second instance on the same pair of types would
be ambiguous. The action laws are therefore stated as plain lemmas, and
`TauCeti.dotActionPerm` collects them into a group homomorphism for consumers that want to speak of
orbits or stabilizers.

The definition needs `2` to be invertible in the coefficient ring, since `ρ` does; nothing else
here asks for more than the statement it appears in. In particular the action laws and the
`ρ`-shift equivariance are proved with no crystallographic, reduced or order hypothesis, the
simple-reflection formulas add only what `TauCeti.reflection_weylVector` needs, and the ordered
hypotheses appear only in the dominant-chamber section.

## References

This file supplies the root-pairing-level prerequisite of the `dotAction` target of
`TauCetiRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/LieHighestWeight/README.md`, whose Layer 7 states "the **dot
action** `w · λ = w(λ+ρ) - ρ` is the linear Weyl action recentred at `-ρ`" and whose
`Suggested.lean` pins `dotAction (base) (w) (lam)` on `Module.Dual K H`; as with
`TauCeti.weylVector`, the combinatorics lives at the level of an abstract root pairing, so the
Lie-algebra target is a specialization rather than a rebuild. The freeness on the closed dominant
chamber is what the roadmap's `centralCharacter_injOn_isDominantIntegral` consumes.

The argument is the one in J. E. Humphreys, *Introduction to Lie Algebras and Representation
Theory*, GTM 9, Ch. III, §13.2 and Ch. VI, §23.3.

/-- The **open dominant chamber of the dot action**: the weights whose `ρ`-shift is strictly
dominant, equivalently (`TauCeti.mem_openDotDominantChamber_iff_neg_one_lt_coroot'`) those with

This, and not `RootPairing.dominantChamber`, is the region the dot action is free on for a general
coefficient ring: the walls of the dot action sit at `⟨x, αᵢ^∨⟩ = -1`
(`TauCeti.dotAction_ofIdx_eq_self_iff`), so this is the open chamber the dot action cuts out. Every
dominant weight lies in it (`TauCeti.dominantChamber_subset_openDotDominantChamber`), and the
containment may be strict; for integral weights the two conditions agree, since `-1 < ⟨x, αᵢ^∨⟩`
then forces `0 ≤ ⟨x, αᵢ^∨⟩`. -/
