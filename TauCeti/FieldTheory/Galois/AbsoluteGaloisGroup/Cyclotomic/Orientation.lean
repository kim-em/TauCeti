# The cyclotomic orientation of the maximal pro-`p` Galois group

Let `K` be a field containing a primitive `p`-th root of unity `ζ`. Every `σ` in the absolute
Galois group fixes `ζ`, and the cyclotomic character reduced modulo `p` records the exponent `j`
with `σ ζ = ζ ^ j`. Hence every value of `localCyclotomicCharacter p K` is a principal unit
`≡ 1 mod p`, and the image of the character is a pro-`p` subgroup of `ℤ_pˣ`. A continuous
homomorphism to the profinite pro-`p` group `1 + pℤ_p` kills the pro-`p` kernel of the absolute
Galois group, so the character descends to its maximal pro-`p` quotient `G_K(p)`.

The descended character `cyclotomicOrientation p K hmu : G_K(p) →ₜ* ℤ_pˣ` is the arithmetic
orientation of `G_K(p)`, the character to compare with the canonical character of `G_K(p)` when
it is a Demushkin group. It is a continuous homomorphism, the form taken by the twisted
coefficients `ZModTwist` and the prescription property `HasPrescriptionProperty`. It takes the
roots-of-unity witness `hmu` as an explicit argument, and no unconditional descent of the full
character is provided: for odd `p` and `K = ℚ_p` the character reduced modulo `p` maps the
absolute Galois group onto `(ℤ/pℤ)ˣ`, a nontrivial group of order prime to `p`, so it does not
factor through any pro-`p` group.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.cyclotomicOrientation p K hmu`: the cyclotomic character descended to
  `absoluteGaloisGroupProP p K`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.isProP_range_localCyclotomicCharacter`: if `μ_p ⊆ K`, the image of the cyclotomic
  character is pro-`p`.
* `TauCeti.proPKernel_le_ker_localCyclotomicCharacter`: if `μ_p ⊆ K`, the pro-`p` kernel of the
  absolute Galois group lies in the kernel of the cyclotomic character.
* `TauCeti.cyclotomicOrientation_mk`,
  `TauCeti.cyclotomicOrientation_comp_absoluteGaloisGroupProPQuotientMap`,
  `TauCeti.cyclotomicOrientation_range`: the orientation agrees with the character on classes,
  pulls back to the continuous character along the quotient map, and has the same image as the
  character.
