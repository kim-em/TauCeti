# The cyclotomic character of an absolute Galois group

The character `localCyclotomicCharacter p K` records the action of
`Field.absoluteGaloisGroup K` on roots of unity of `p`-power order in an algebraic closure.
It is Mathlib's cyclotomic character restricted from ring automorphisms to the Galois group.
The pointwise equation fixes this choice of character for later arithmetic comparisons.
Its bundled form `continuousLocalCyclotomicCharacter p K` is the continuous homomorphism that the
twisted coefficients `TauCeti.ZModTwist` and the prescription property
`TauCeti.HasPrescriptionProperty` take. It factors through the topological abelianization as
`abelianizedLocalCyclotomicCharacter p K`, which is how it is evaluated on Artin symbols.
