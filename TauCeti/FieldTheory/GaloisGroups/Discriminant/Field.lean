# The discriminant field `F(√disc f)`

Let `f` be a polynomial over a field `F` and let `E` be an extension of `F`. The **discriminant
field** of `f` in `E` is the subfield of `E` generated over `F` by the square roots of
`Polynomial.discr f` that lie in `E`. It is `TauCeti.discrField f E`, defined as the adjunction to
`F` of the root set of `X ^ 2 - C f.discr` in `E`.

Whenever `E` contains an element `δ` with `δ ^ 2 = discr f` — for monic separable `f` splitting in
`E` the square root `TauCeti.discrSqrt` of the previous file is one — the definition collapses to
the simple extension `F⟮δ⟯`, because the only other square root of the discriminant is `-δ`, and it
is then a splitting field of `X ^ 2 - C f.discr` over `F`. (When `E` contains no square root at all
the root set is empty and the discriminant field is just `F`.) In particular the discriminant field
does not depend on the numbering of the roots that `discrSqrt` is computed from, even though
`discrSqrt` itself changes sign with it. From that description one reads off the two
possibilities: `F⟮δ⟯` is `F` when `discr f` is a square in `F`, and a quadratic extension of `F`
otherwise. Away from characteristic `2` it is moreover a Galois extension of `F` as soon as the
discriminant is nonzero, since `X ^ 2 - C f.discr` is then separable.

The discriminant field is determined by the discriminant alone. The comparison theorem
`TauCeti.fixedField_evenAutSubgroup` characterizes it additionally through the action on the roots
of `f`: in a Galois splitting extension and away from characteristic `2`, the discriminant field is
exactly the field fixed by the automorphisms that permute the roots of `f` evenly. That subgroup is
`TauCeti.evenAutSubgroup f E`. The transformation law `AlgEquiv.map_discrSqrt` makes both
inclusions short: an even automorphism fixes `δ`, and an odd one negates it, which is a genuine move
because `δ ≠ 0` and `2 ≠ 0`.

The same comparison reads factorizations over the discriminant field on the Galois image: in a
normal splitting extension, `f` stays irreducible over its discriminant field exactly when the even
permutations in the Galois image act transitively on the roots
(`TauCeti.irreducible_map_discrField_iff`). Since all discriminant fields are splitting fields of
`X ^ 2 - C f.discr`, whether `f` stays irreducible over one does not depend on the extension `E` in
which it is taken (`TauCeti.irreducible_map_discrField_congr`). This is the datum that separates the
cyclic quartic group from the dihedral one, whose even parts are respectively intransitive and
transitive. The discriminant test of the previous file is recovered here as the statement that the
discriminant field is trivial exactly when the Galois image is contained in the alternating group.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.discrField`: the subfield of `E` generated over `F` by the square roots of `discr f`.
* `TauCeti.evenAutSubgroup`: the automorphisms of a splitting extension `E` over `F` that induce an
  even permutation of the roots of `f`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.discrField_eq_adjoin_simple`: a square root `δ` of the discriminant generates the
  discriminant field.
* `TauCeti.isSplittingField_discrField`: if `E` contains a square root of the discriminant, the
  discriminant field is a splitting field of `X ^ 2 - C f.discr`.
* `TauCeti.discrField_map`: it is natural in the extension.
* `TauCeti.discrField_baseChange`: after extending the base field, it is the compositum of the
  new base field with the original discriminant field.
* `TauCeti.discrField_eq_bot_iff`, `TauCeti.finrank_discrField_eq_two`: the discriminant field is
  `F` exactly when the discriminant is a square, and has degree `2` otherwise.
* `TauCeti.isGalois_discrField`: away from characteristic `2`, and for nonzero discriminant, it is
  a Galois extension of `F`.
* `TauCeti.irreducible_map_discrField_congr`: irreducibility over the discriminant field does not
  depend on the extension in which the discriminant field is taken.
* `TauCeti.fixedField_evenAutSubgroup`: **the comparison theorem**, that the discriminant field is
  the fixed field of the even part of the Galois group, and `TauCeti.fixingSubgroup_discrField`:
  conversely, the even part of the Galois group is the subgroup fixing the discriminant field.
* `TauCeti.irreducible_map_discrField_iff`: `f` stays irreducible over the discriminant field
  exactly when the even part of its Galois image is transitive on the roots.
* `TauCeti.discrField_eq_bot_iff_range_le_alternatingGroup`,
  `TauCeti.finrank_discrField_eq_two_iff`: the discriminant test, read on the discriminant field.

variable {f : F[X]}

/-- **The discriminant field of `f` in `E`**: the subfield of `E` generated over `F` by the square
roots of `Polynomial.discr f` that lie in `E`. If `E` contains such a square root this is a
splitting field of `X ^ 2 - C f.discr` over `F` (`TauCeti.isSplittingField_discrField`); if it
contains none, the root set is empty and the discriminant field is `F` itself.

`TauCeti.discrField_eq_adjoin_simple` describes it as `F⟮δ⟯` for any square root `δ` of the
discriminant in `E`. Stating it as an adjunction of the whole root set instead of a simple
extension keeps it independent of the choice of square root, hence of the numbering of the roots of
`f` that `TauCeti.discrSqrt` is computed from. -/

field of `f` in one to the discriminant field of `f` in the other. Taking `E' = E` it says that
every `F`-automorphism of `E` maps the discriminant field onto itself. -/

`f` after extending scalars from `F` to `K` is the compositum in `E` of `K` with the original
discriminant field. Since a field extension preserves polynomial degree, no hypothesis on `f` is
needed. When `E` contains a square root of `f.discr` and the image of `f.discr` remains a
nonsquare in `K`, the base-changed field is still quadratic over `K` by
`TauCeti.finrank_discrField_baseChange_eq_two`. -/
