# The Galois group of a quintic

An irreducible separable quintic over a field carries exactly one of the five transitive-group
labels `5T1`, …, `5T5`. For a monic such quintic, two data constrain the label. Away from
characteristic `2` the discriminant reads its parity: it is a square exactly for the even labels
`5T1`, `5T2` and `5T4`. Dummit's `F₂₀` resolvent sextic gives an unconditional implication from
solvability to having a root in the base field; when its specialization is separable, the converse
holds as well, so a root is then equivalent to one of the labels `5T1`, `5T2` and `5T3`.

For monic quintics, the two data together separate `5T3`, `5T4` and `5T5` from each other and from
the rest, and this file proves those three identifications, together with a fourth branch
concluding `5T1` or `5T2`:

| discriminant | resolvent sextic | label |
|---|---|---|
| not a square | no root in the base field | `5T5` |
| a square | no root in the base field | `5T4` |
| not a square | a root in the base field | `5T3` |
| a square | a root in the base field | `5T1` **or** `5T2` |

The fourth row concludes only that the label is `5T1` or `5T2`.
An independent criterion identifies `5T1` when the root field has a nonidentity automorphism.

The first two rows need no hypothesis on the resolvent sextic, because they use only the
unconditional direction of the resolvent criterion, that a solvable Galois group produces a root.
The last two rows read a root of the sextic as a containment, which is sound only when the
specialized sextic is separable; separability of `f` does not imply it, since specialization can
make the values of two distinct orbit elements collide.

The two characterizations behind the table, `TauCeti.HasGaloisLabel.isSquare_discr_iff_five` and
`TauCeti.HasGaloisLabel.exists_isRoot_specialize_quinticF20Spec_iff`, are equivalences when the
specialized resolvent is separable, so under that additional hypothesis they also supply the
converse of each row.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.existsUnique_hasGaloisLabel_five`: an irreducible separable quintic carries exactly one
  label, and `TauCeti.hasGaloisLabel_five_iff_natCard_gal`: the order of its Galois group
  recognizes that label.
* `TauCeti.hasGaloisLabel_five_four_of_surjective_galActionHom`: a quintic whose Galois group
  acts on its roots by every permutation has the label `5T5`.
* `TauCeti.HasGaloisLabel.isSolvable_iff_five`: the Galois group of a quintic is solvable
  exactly for the labels `5T1`, `5T2` and `5T3`.
* `TauCeti.HasGaloisLabel.isSquare_discr_iff_five`: **the discriminant reads the parity of the
  label**, and `TauCeti.HasGaloisLabel.exists_isRoot_specialize_quinticF20Spec_iff`: **a root of
  the separable resolvent sextic reads solvability of the label**.
* `TauCeti.hasGaloisLabel_five_four_of_not_isSquare_discr_of_forall_not_isRoot`,
  `TauCeti.hasGaloisLabel_five_three_of_isSquare_discr_of_forall_not_isRoot`,
  `TauCeti.hasGaloisLabel_five_two_of_not_isSquare_discr_of_isRoot`,
  `TauCeti.hasGaloisLabel_five_zero_or_one_of_isSquare_discr_of_isRoot`: the four rows of the
  table above.
* `TauCeti.hasGaloisLabel_five_zero_of_exists_rootField_aut_ne_one`: a nonidentity
  automorphism of a quintic root field identifies the label as `5T1`.
