# Degree of the root permutation representation

This file records the degree bookkeeping for the faithful permutation representation of the
Galois group of a polynomial. A separable polynomial has `natDegree` distinct roots in its
splitting field, so its intrinsic root set admits a numbering by `Fin p.natDegree`. No numbering
is chosen globally: the result is stated as a `Nonempty` equivalence, leaving later comparisons
with reference permutation groups to carry their chosen numbering explicitly.

The Galois action itself is faithful over every splitting extension. Consequently its image has
the same cardinality as the polynomial Galois group, and the Galois-group order divides the
factorial of the polynomial degree. For the same reason the Galois group of a polynomial of degree
at most four embeds in a symmetric group on at most four points, and is therefore solvable.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.nonempty_rootSet_splittingField_equiv_fin`: a separable polynomial's roots in its
  splitting field can be numbered by `Fin p.natDegree`.
* `TauCeti.natCard_galActionHom_range`: the faithful Galois image has the order of the polynomial
  Galois group.
* `TauCeti.natCard_gal_dvd_factorial_card_rootSet`: the Galois-group order divides the factorial
  of the number of distinct roots.
* `TauCeti.natCard_gal_dvd_factorial_natDegree`: the order of a polynomial's Galois group divides
  the factorial of its degree.
* `TauCeti.isSolvable_gal_of_natDegree_le_four`: a polynomial of degree at most four has a
  solvable Galois group.

The proofs reuse Mathlib's `Polynomial.card_rootSet_eq_natDegree`,
`Polynomial.Gal.galActionHom_injective`, `MonoidHom.ofInjective`, and Lagrange's theorem. This is
the degree bookkeeping used by the orbit-to-factor dictionary and by low-degree label predicates.

/-! ## Numbering the roots -/

/-- A separable polynomial's roots in its splitting field admit a numbering by
`Fin p.natDegree`.

Only existence is recorded: later statements choose a numbering locally, so the intrinsic root
set is not equipped with a global order. -/
theorem nonempty_rootSet_splittingField_equiv_fin (p : F[X]) (hsep : p.Separable) :
    Nonempty (p.rootSet p.SplittingField ≃ Fin p.natDegree) := by

/-- The image of the Galois action on the roots in any splitting extension has the same order as
the polynomial Galois group. -/

/-! ## Solvability in degree at most four -/

/-- **A polynomial of degree at most four has a solvable Galois group.** The Galois group acts
faithfully on the at most four roots in the splitting field, and the symmetric group on at most
four points is solvable. Neither separability nor irreducibility is needed. This is a statement
about the group, not about `solvableByRad`. -/
