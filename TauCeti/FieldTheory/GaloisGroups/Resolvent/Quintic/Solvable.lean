# Solvability of a quintic from its resolvent sextic

Let `f` be a monic irreducible separable quintic over a field `F`.  The Galois group of `f` is
solvable exactly when its permutation image on the five roots lies in a conjugate of the
Frobenius group `F₂₀ = 5T3`.  The resolvent attached to
`TauCeti.quinticF20Spec` detects exactly that containment: provided the specialized resolvent is
separable, it has a root in `F` if and only if the image lies in a conjugate of `F₂₀`.

Thus a separable specialized resolvent has a root in the base field exactly when the polynomial
Galois group is solvable.  Separability of `f` does not imply separability of the resolvent and
cannot replace that hypothesis: specialization can make distinct values of the six universal
orbit elements collide.

No characteristic restriction is needed for this group-and-resolvent statement.  Restrictions
on characteristics two and five enter the separate discriminant and depression arguments, not
the exact-stabilizer criterion used here.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.exists_isRoot_specialize_quinticF20Spec_of_isSolvable`: a solvable Galois group gives
  the `F₂₀` resolvent a root in the base field, with no hypothesis on the resolvent.
* `TauCeti.isSolvable_gal_iff_exists_isRoot_specialize_quinticF20Spec`: the Galois group of an
  irreducible separable quintic is solvable exactly when its separable `F₂₀` resolvent has a
  root in the base field.

## References

* D. S. Dummit, *Solving solvable quintics*, Mathematics of Computation **57** (1991), Theorem 1.
  The separability hypothesis here makes explicit the distinct-value condition used when a
  resolvent root is read as containment in an invariant's stabilizer.

/-- **A solvable quintic Galois group gives the resolvent a root.** Let `f` be a monic irreducible
separable quintic over a field. If the polynomial Galois group is solvable, then the
specialization of Dummit's `F₂₀` resolvent has a root in the base field.

Nothing is assumed about the resolvent here; the converse direction, in
`TauCeti.isSolvable_gal_iff_exists_isRoot_specialize_quinticF20Spec`, does assume its
separability. -/
