# Separably closed fields

Supplements to Mathlib's `IsSepClosed` and `IsSepClosure` for domain algebras, quadratics,
and towers of field extensions.

## Separable elements in domain algebras

A separable element of an algebra over a separably closed field belongs to the image of that
field when the ambient algebra is a domain. The algebra can be noncommutative, and no algebraicity
or separability assumption is needed on its other elements.

## Quadratics over a separably closed field

A separably closed field solves every quadratic **except** the inseparable ones. A quadratic
`a X² + b X + c` with `a ≠ 0` is inseparable exactly when its derivative `2a X + b` vanishes, that
is when `2 = 0` and `b = 0`; away from that case the equation has a root in the field itself.

Both halves are already available. Where `2 ≠ 0` the quadratic formula applies as soon as the
discriminant is a square, and a separably closed field supplies square roots
(`IsSepClosed.isSquare`). Where `2 = 0` the polynomial `a X² + b X + c` with `b ≠ 0` is
separable, and `IsSepClosed.exists_root_C_mul_X_pow_add_C_mul_X_add_C` is exactly that case.

The excluded case is genuinely excluded: over an imperfect separably closed field of
characteristic `2`, such as the separable closure of `𝔽₂(t)`, the equation `X² = t` has no
solution.

## Separable closures in a tower

A separable closure of `K` is a separable closure of every intermediate extension `L` of the
tower `K ⊆ L ⊆ E`: separable closedness is a property of the field `E` alone, and an element
separable over `K` is separable over `L`. Mathlib records `IsSepClosure` only for the base of a
tower, so this file supplies the step up the tower.

The statement is a theorem rather than an instance because the base field `K` does not appear in
its conclusion, so instance search could not find it.

## Main results

* `IsSeparable.mem_bot_of_isSepClosed`: a separable element of a domain algebra belongs to the
  bottom subalgebra.
* `TauCeti.exists_quadratic_eq_zero_of_isSepClosed`
* `TauCeti.isSepClosure_tower_top`: `IsSepClosure K E` implies `IsSepClosure L E` for every
  intermediate extension `L`.
* `SeparableClosure.neZero_two`: `2` stays nonzero in `SeparableClosure K`.

/-- **A quadratic with a nonvanishing derivative has a root in a separably closed field.** The
derivative of `a X² + b X + c` is `2a X + b`, so the hypothesis `2 ≠ 0 ∨ b ≠ 0` says exactly that
the quadratic is separable; without it the equation can be `X² = t` for a non-square `t`, which has
no solution over an imperfect separably closed field of characteristic `2`. -/
