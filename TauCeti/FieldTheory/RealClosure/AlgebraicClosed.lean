/-! # Algebraic closedness of the complexification

`finrank_eq_one_of_forall_isSquare` proves that a finite extension of a finite
square-closed extension of a real closed field is trivial. `isAlgClosed_of_forall_isSquare`
then proves algebraic closedness of that square-closed field. In particular,
`isAlgClosed_quadraticAlgebra` proves that `R[i] = QuadraticAlgebra R (-1) 0` is
algebraically closed. `Polynomial.natDegree_le_two_of_irreducible` bounds irreducible degrees
by two; the polynomial IVT development uses this bound.
Open `scoped TauCeti.RealClosure` to enable the algebraic-closedness instance on this
quadratic algebra.

The proof puts finite extensions inside a finite normal closure. The 2-group argument
then applies to the Galois group over a square-closed intermediate field.

The degree bound generalizes Mathlib's `Irreducible.natDegree_le_two` from
`Mathlib.Analysis.Complex.Polynomial.Basic`, following its root, minimal polynomial,
and finite-dimension proof over an arbitrary real closed field.

## References

The algebraic argument uses a Sylow 2-subgroup of the Galois group; see Salma Kuhlmann,
