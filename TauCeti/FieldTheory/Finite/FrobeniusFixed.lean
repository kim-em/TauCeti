# The fixed points of the `q`-power map over a finite field

For a finite field `K` with `q` elements and any commutative domain `L` that is a `K`-algebra, an
element of `L` is fixed by the `q`-power map exactly when it comes from `K`:

`a ^ q = a ↔ a ∈ Set.range (algebraMap K L)`.

So an element outside `K` is moved by the map. In a quadratic extension the map is moreover an
involution, since `L` then has `q²` elements, and it therefore exchanges the two roots of the
minimal polynomial of such an element; in particular it keeps it outside `K`. Those statements are
what the elliptic conjugacy classes of `GL₂(𝔽_q)` are read off from.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.FiniteField.pow_card_eq_self_iff_mem_range_algebraMap`: the criterion above, with
  `TauCeti.FiniteField.pow_natCard_eq_self_iff_mem_range_algebraMap` its `Nat.card` spelling.
* `TauCeti.algebraMap_bijective_of_pow_card_eq_self`: its immediate global consequence, that a
  domain over `K` *all* of whose elements are fixed by the `q`-power map is `K` itself.
* `TauCeti.FiniteField.pow_natCard_pow_natCard`: in a quadratic extension the `q`-power map is an
  involution, with `TauCeti.FiniteField.pow_natCard_ne` and
  `TauCeti.FiniteField.pow_natCard_notMem_range_algebraMap` its two consequences for an element
  outside `K`.

Mathlib has the easy direction (`FiniteField.pow_card`) but not the equivalence.
`IsGalois.mem_range_algebraMap_iff_fixed` characterises the base field of a Galois extension by
being fixed, but it needs `[FiniteDimensional F E]` and quantifies over the whole Galois group
rather than the single `q`-power map.

`L` need not be a field: a commutative domain is enough, which covers polynomial rings over `K`,
and the coordinate ring of an integral affine curve such as a Weierstrass curve, as well as field
extensions. Nor need `L` be algebraically closed, which is the only case the source states.

This is the elementary field-theoretic input to the Silverman V.1 route to the Hasse bound: it says
that the `K`-rational coordinates are exactly the Frobenius-fixed ones.

## Provenance

Ported from the AINTLIB `HasseWeil` project (`github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB`, Apache-2.0,
`dev/hasse-weil @ 513e83879e2f`),
`HasseWeil/Curves/FrobeniusFixedLocus.lean`, declaration `frobenius_fixed_iff_mem_baseField`.

Changes from the source. It is stated there only for `L = AlgebraicClosure K`; here `L` is an
arbitrary commutative domain over `K`, since nothing in the argument uses algebraic closedness or
inverses. The source
builds the root-set transport by hand, through a separability argument and a finset count; here
that is Mathlib's `Splits.image_rootSet` applied to `FiniteField.isSplittingField_sub`. And the
source's other public theorem is stated in terms of its own `private` finsets, so it cannot be
applied from outside; it is not reproduced. Nine declarations become one.
