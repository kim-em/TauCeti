# Relations among the generators of `PSL(2, ℤ)`

In `PSL(2, ℤ)` the classes of `S = (0 -1; 1 0)` and `U = T * S = (1 -1; 1 0)`, where
`T = (1 1; 0 1)`, satisfy `S² = 1` and `U³ = 1`, and `U * S = T`. In `SL(2, ℤ)` the first two
products are `-1` and the last is `-T`, so each relation is proved by checking that the
corresponding element of `SL(2, ℤ)` is `±1`, that is, central. Likewise `U² * S` is the class of
the lower-triangular matrix `T′ = (1 0; 1 1)`.

`U` is written `(T : PSL(2, ℤ)) * S`, the simp-normal form of the class of `T * S`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.ModularGroup.T_mul_S_pow_three`: `(T * S)³ = -1` in `SL(2, ℤ)`.
* `TauCeti.ModularGroup.coe_S_sq`, `TauCeti.ModularGroup.coe_S_inv`: `S² = 1` and `S⁻¹ = S`.
* `TauCeti.ModularGroup.coe_T_mul_coe_S_pow_three`, `TauCeti.ModularGroup.coe_T_mul_coe_S_inv`,
  `TauCeti.ModularGroup.coe_T_mul_coe_S_sq_inv`: `U³ = 1`, `U⁻¹ = U²` and `(U²)⁻¹ = U`.
* `Matrix.ProjectiveSpecialLinearGroup.mul_coe_S_mul_coe_S`: `g * S * S = g`, the product form of
  `S² = 1`; in particular `U * S = T`.
* `TauCeti.ModularGroup.tPrime`, `TauCeti.ModularGroup.coe_tPrime`,
  `TauCeti.ModularGroup.coe_T_mul_coe_S_sq_mul_coe_S`: the matrix `T′ = (1 0; 1 1)` and
  `U² * S = T′`.
