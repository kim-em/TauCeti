# The norm on the graded pieces of the unit filtration

Let `L/K` be a finite Galois extension of nonarchimedean local fields, and let
`ψℕ_{L/K} : ℕ → ℕ` be its integral inverse Herbrand function. The norm carries
`U(L, ψℕ_{L/K}(v))` into `U(K, v)` and `U(L, ψℕ_{L/K}(v) + 1)` into `U(K, v + 1)`, so it induces
a homomorphism of graded pieces

`normGradedMap K L v : U(L, ψℕ_{L/K}(v)) / U(L, ψℕ_{L/K}(v) + 1) →* U(K, v) / U(K, v + 1)`.

For a Galois extension of prime degree these maps compare the unit filtrations of `L` and `K`
step by step, and the orders of their kernels and cokernels are what the conductor and the
Hasse–Arf theorem are computed from. This file computes them away from the break and at a
positive break.

*Depth zero.* For a totally ramified Galois extension of degree `n`, `ψℕ_{L/K}(0) = 0`, both
graded pieces are the multiplicative groups of the residue fields, and these residue fields
coincide. Every element of the Galois group lies in the inertia group, so it acts trivially on the
residue field, and the norm `N(u) = ∏_σ σ(u)` of a unit `u` reduces to `ū ^ n`. Thus
`normGradedMap K L 0` is the `n`-th power map of the cyclic group `𝓀ˣ` of order `q - 1`, and its
kernel and cokernel both have order `gcd(q - 1, n)`. If `L/K` is tamely ramified, then `n`
divides `q - 1`, because the inertia group, of order `n`, embeds into `𝓀ˣ` through the tame
character; so the kernel and the cokernel have order `n`. If instead `G_1 = Gal(L/K)`, then `n`
is a power of the residue characteristic `p`, which is prime to `q - 1`, and the map is bijective.

*Before the break.* Let `L/K` have prime degree and let `v > 0` satisfy `G_{v+1} = Gal(L/K)`.
Then `ψℕ_{L/K}(v) = v`, and Hilbert's formula gives `d(L/K) ≥ (v + 2)([L : K] - 1)`, so the trace
carries `𝓂[L] ^ v` into `𝓂[K] ^ (v + 1)`. In the expansion
`N(1 + z) = 1 + Tr(z) + Tr(y) + N(z)` of `TauCeti.exists_norm_one_add_eq_of_mem_maximalIdeal_pow`
only `N(z)` survives modulo `𝓂[K] ^ (v + 1)`, and the norm preserves valuations in a totally
ramified extension. So `normGradedMap K L v` is injective, and it is bijective because both graded
pieces have `q` elements.

*At the break.* Let `L/K` have prime degree `ℓ`, let `t > 0` satisfy `G_t = Gal(L/K)`, and let
`σ ∉ G_{t+1}`, so that `σ π - π = γ π ^ (t + 1)` for a uniformizer `π` of `L` and an integer `γ`
whose residue `c` is nonzero. Coordinatize `U(L, t) / U(L, t + 1)` by `π` and
`U(K, t) / U(K, t + 1)` by `N(π)`. Here `ψℕ_{L/K}(t) = t`, and the trace carries `𝓂[L] ^ (t + 1)`
into `𝓂[K] ^ (t + 1)`, so the expansion of `N(1 + a π ^ t)` gives the class of
`a ^ ℓ + β a` for a constant `β`, the residue of `Tr(π ^ t) / N(π) ^ t`. The unit `σ π / π` has
coordinate `c` and norm `1`, so `c ^ ℓ + β c = 0`, which forces `β = -c ^ (ℓ - 1)`: the graded norm
is `y ↦ y ^ ℓ - c ^ (ℓ - 1) y`. When `t` is the break of the filtration, the Galois group is
`G_1`, a `p`-group of order `ℓ`, so `ℓ = p`, and the kernel of this map is the line `𝔽_ℓ c`. Hence
the kernel and the cokernel of `normGradedMap K L t` both have order `ℓ`.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.normGradedMap`: the homomorphism of graded pieces induced by the norm.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.algebraMap_residue_norm_of_isTotallyRamified`: in a totally ramified Galois extension
  of degree `n`, the norm of an integer `z` reduces to the `n`-th power of the residue of `z`.
* `TauCeti.algebraMap_unitFiltrationGradedZeroEquivResidueFieldUnits_normGradedMap_mk`: the
  depth-zero graded norm is the `n`-th power map on residue units.
* `TauCeti.natCard_ker_normGradedMap_zero` and `TauCeti.index_range_normGradedMap_zero`: its
  kernel and its cokernel have order `gcd(q - 1, n)`; `TauCeti.normGradedMap_zero_bijective_iff`:
  it is bijective exactly when `n` is prime to `q - 1`.
* `TauCeti.normGradedMap_tame_break_zero`: in the tame case both have order `n`.
* `TauCeti.normGradedMap_zero_bijective_of_lowerRamificationGroup_one_eq_top`: if
  `G_1 = Gal(L/K)`, the depth-zero graded norm is bijective.
* `TauCeti.normGradedMap_bijective_of_lowerRamificationGroup_eq_top`: in prime degree, the graded
  norm at depth `v` is bijective whenever `G_{v+1} = Gal(L/K)`.
* `TauCeti.normGradedMap_zero_before_break` and `TauCeti.normGradedMap_positive_before_break`: in
  prime degree with an upper break at a natural number `t`, the graded norm is bijective at every
  depth `v < t`.
* `TauCeti.algebraMap_residue_eq_of_norm_one_add_mul_pow_eq` and
  `TauCeti.algebraMap_unitFiltrationGradedSuccEquivResidueFieldOfUniformizer_normGradedMap_mk`: in
  prime degree, at a positive depth `t` with `G_t = Gal(L/K)` and for `σ ∉ G_{t+1}`, the graded
  norm is `y ↦ y ^ ℓ - c ^ (ℓ - 1) y`, where `c` is the coordinate of `σ π / π`.
* `TauCeti.normGradedMap_at_break`: in prime degree `ℓ` with an upper break at a natural number
  `t > 0`, the kernel and the cokernel of the graded norm at depth `t` both have order `ℓ`.
