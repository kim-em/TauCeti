# Hecke rings: the double coset API

Basic API for the double cosets `HeckeCoset` indexing a Hecke coset module, following
[Shimura][shimura1971], Chapter 3. This file provides representatives of double cosets, the
characterisation of when two elements give the same double coset, and the quotient
`Γ₁ ⧸ (Γ₁ ∩ gΓ₂g⁻¹)` indexing the left cosets inside a double coset `Γ₁gΓ₂`, which is used to
define the Hecke product in later files and is finite for a Hecke triple. It also houses
the basis-element API of the coset module: `HeckeCosetModule.single` with its evaluation,
summation, and additivity laws, the `induction_linear` principle, and the transported
`Module` instance — placed at this layer so every later file (convolution, one, and the
coset actions) can build on one shared vocabulary. Finally it defines the degree of a
double coset, the number of left cosets in its decomposition, together with its
relative-index form, since that count is read straight off `DecompQuotient`.

The coset vocabulary is vendored from the in-review mathlib4 PR
[#41253](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/41253) (Chris Birkbeck), per the
ModularForms roadmap's dependency policy; migrate to Mathlib and delete it when that stack
merges. The degree section is instead ported from the AINTLIB `LeanModularForms` project
(`LeanModularForms/HeckeRIngs/AbstractHeckeRing/Degree.lean`, Chris Birkbeck,
<https://github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB/tree/main/projects/LeanModularForms>).

## Main definitions

* `HeckeCoset.toSet`: the underlying set `H₁gH₂` of a double coset.
* `HeckeCoset.rep`: a chosen representative in `Δ`.
* `HeckeCoset.map`: functoriality in the triple `(Δ, H₁, H₂)` along inclusions — widening the
  coefficient subgroups can only merge double cosets, never split them. Its computation rule is
  `map_mk` and its functor laws are `map_id` and `map_map`; `HeckeRing.GL2.toLevelOneCoset`
  (`HeckeRing/GL2/Gamma0/CosetMap.lean`) is its `Γ₀`-specialisation.
* `HeckeCoset.restrict` and `HeckeCoset.restrictEquiv`: a Hecke coset re-read over a subgroup
  `H` containing its whole triple, and the resulting equivalence of quotients. Where
  `HeckeCoset.map` moves a coset along inclusions *within* a fixed ambient group, these move it
  *between* ambient groups — the case a theorem needs when it is applied along a homomorphism
  defined only on a subgroup.
* `DoubleCoset.DecompQuotient`: the quotient `Γ₁ ⧸ (Γ₁ ∩ gΓ₂g⁻¹)` indexing the left cosets
  in `Γ₁gΓ₂`; finite for a Hecke triple. Its mirror `DecompQuotient Γ₂ Γ₁ g⁻¹` indexes the
  right cosets `Γ₁a`, and is finite too.
* `DoubleCoset.decompQuotientEquivMapOfInjective`: that quotient transported along an injective
  homomorphism, with `DoubleCoset.map_subgroupOf_smul` for the subgroup underneath it;
  `DoubleCoset.decompQuotientEquivMap` (`HeckeRing/Multiplicity/Equiv.lean`) is its special case
  at an isomorphism.
* `DoubleCoset.decompQuotientEquivMapOfKerInfLe`: the same transport **without** injectivity,
  under an ambient subgroup `H` containing `Γ₂` and receiving `g⁻¹ Γ₁ g`, and
  `φ.ker ⊓ H ≤ Γ₂`. The target element is supplied by an equation `hd : φ g = d`, so a consumer
  holding `(φ g)⁻¹` rather than `φ g⁻¹` needs no type transport of its own. This is the version a
  fundamental-domain statement needs: the group that acts
  faithfully on `ℍ` is a *quotient*, so the homomorphism reaching it is deliberately non-injective,
  and the kernel is absorbed by the denominator instead.
* `HeckeCosetModule.single`: the basis element `b • [D]` of the Hecke coset module, with
  `single_apply`, `sum_single_index`, `smul_single_one`, `single_add`, `induction_linear`,
  and the `Module R` instance `HeckeCosetModule.instModule`.
* Pointwise evaluation of the coset module: `zero_apply`, `add_apply`, `smul_apply`,
  `mem_support_iff`, `notMem_support_iff`, `sum_def`, `sum_apply` and `sum_smul_index`.
  `HeckeCosetModule` is a `def` over `Finsupp` carrying transported instances, so Mathlib's
  `Finsupp` evaluation lemmas hold *definitionally* — they can be applied in term mode — but
  `rw`, `simp` and `grind` match syntactically and so cannot see through the wrapper. These
  restatements are what makes those facts usable tactically.

  In particular these do not compete with their `Finsupp` originals: at this type
  `simp [Finsupp.mem_support_iff]` reports the argument as unused and `simp [Finsupp.add_apply]`
  makes no progress, because neither left-hand side matches through the wrapper. The wrapper
  restatement is the only form `simp` can apply.
* `HeckeCoset.degree`: the number of left cosets in the decomposition of a double coset,
  with `degree_eq_relIndex` and `degree_mk` presenting it as a relative index,
  `degree_eq_natCard_decompQuotient` as the (hypothesis-free) count of that quotient, and
  `degree_one` the identity coset.

## Main results

* `HeckeCoset.eq_iff`: `mk H₁ H₂ g = mk H₁ H₂ h ↔ H₁gH₂ = H₁hH₂`.
* `HeckeCoset.toSet_injective`: a double coset is determined by its underlying set.
* `DoubleCoset.doubleCoset_eq_iUnion_rightCosets` and
  `DoubleCoset.op_mul_out_inv_smul_injective`: Shimura's decomposition `Γ₁gΓ₂ = ⊔ᵥ Γ₁(gτᵥ⁻¹)`
  into *right* cosets, indexed without repetition by `DecompQuotient Γ₂ Γ₁ g⁻¹` — the mirror of
  `DoubleCoset.doubleCoset_eq_iUnion_leftCosets` and `mk_out_mul_injective`.
* `DoubleCoset.doubleCoset_eq_iUnion_rightCosets_of_forall_exists`: a criterion for a supplied
  family of right-coset representatives to cover a double coset.
* `DoubleCoset.rightCosetRep_mem`, `DoubleCoset.exists_mem_out_mul_inv_eq_mul_rightCosetRep` and
  `DoubleCoset.exists_bijective_rightCosetRep_smul_eq`: the representatives `δ τᵥ⁻¹` lie in any
  submonoid containing `δ` and `Γ₂`; an element `δ h₂⁻¹` of the double coset is a `Γ₁`-multiple of
  the representative of `h₂`'s class; and any family of representatives of the right cosets is
  matched with the chosen one by a bijection — the coset bookkeeping every operator built by
  summing over the decomposition (slash sums, Hecke sums on a representation) reindexes with.
* `DoubleCoset.card_filter_eq_of_rightCosetRep_smul_eq`: a family naming each right coset of the
  double coset exactly `m` times has exactly `m` members over each chosen representative — the
  counting half of collapsing such a sum to `m •` the operator.
* `DoubleCoset.doubleCoset_mul_doubleCoset_eq_iUnion_rightCosets`: Shimura's covering identity —
  the products `aᵢbⱼ` of two families of right-coset representatives cover the product set
  `Γ₁δ₁Γ₂ · Γ₂δ₂Γ₃`, though not without repetition.
* `IsHeckeTriple.commensurable_conjAct_inv_left`, and the `Finite` instance beside it: that
  right-coset index is finite, the mirror of the `Fintype` instance on `DecompQuotient H₁ H₂ g`.
* `HeckeCoset.restrict_bijective`, with `HeckeCoset.restrict_injective` and
  `HeckeCoset.restrict_surjective`: restriction loses nothing — the double cosets of `Δ` and those
  of `Δ.comap H.subtype` are the same objects described twice.

/-- The underlying set `H₁gH₂` of a double coset, well-defined on the quotient.

The `@[simp]` lemma `toSet_mk` evaluates it at a representative and `toSet_eq_doubleCoset_rep` at

/-- The chosen representative in `Δ` of a double coset `D`, picked by `Quotient.out`: it lies
in `D.toSet` (`rep_mem`), and `mk_rep` recovers `D` from it. The choice is arbitrary —
`(mk H₁ H₂ w).rep` need not be `w`; it only spans the same double coset (`doubleCoset_rep_mk`). -/
noncomputable def rep (D : HeckeCoset Δ H₁ H₂) : Δ := Quotient.out D

theorem rep_def (D : HeckeCoset Δ H₁ H₂) : D.rep = Quotient.out D := (rfl)

/-- The double coset of a chosen representative is the double coset it was chosen from. -/
-- The `simp` normal form eliminating `rep`. Mathlib's `Quotient.out_eq'` is the same fact one
-- level down, but matches on `Quotient.mk''` and `Quotient.out` rather than the `mk` and `rep`

/-- Two elements of `Δ` define the same `HeckeCoset` iff their double cosets coincide.

The right-hand side is an equality of subsets of the ambient group `G`, so `g` and `h` are
identified through elements of `H₁` and `H₂` that need not lie in `Δ`. Use
`HeckeCoset.mk_eq_mk_of_mem` for the one-directional form starting from a membership. -/

/-- **Membership in the underlying set characterises the double coset**: for `g : Δ`, the element
`g` lies in `D.toSet` exactly when `D` is the double coset of `g`.

This is the elimination rule for `toSet`: it turns a membership into an equation between double
cosets, so a consumer need not unfold the quotient. It is the `Δ`-indexed analogue of Mathlib's
`DoubleCoset.mem_quotToDoubleCoset_iff`, which characterises membership for the double cosets of
the whole group `G`. -/

-- on are those stated at an abstract `D`, where turning a membership into an equation of cosets is

The `toSet`-evaluated form of `rep_mem` at an explicit `mk H₁ H₂ w`. Its mirror

the `∈` and the representative inside the `doubleCoset`. -/

/-- **`mk` and `rep` name the same double coset**: the chosen representative of `mk H₁ H₂ w`

The cancellation holds only inside `doubleCoset`: `(mk H₁ H₂ w).rep = w` is false in general, as
the representative is chosen arbitrarily from the coset. `mem_doubleCoset_rep_mk` and
`rep_mk_mem_doubleCoset` are its membership forms. -/

/-- `mk H₁ H₂ g₁ = mk H₁ H₂ g₂` when `g₁` lies in the double coset of `g₂`.

The one-directional form of `eq_iff`, starting from a membership rather than an equality of sets.
The membership is between the images in `G`, so call sites typically supply it as
`DoubleCoset.mem_doubleCoset.mpr ⟨l, hl, r, hr, _⟩` after unfolding any `Δ`-side coercion.
Mathlib's `DoubleCoset.mk_eq_of_doubleCoset_eq` does not cover this: its conclusion lands in the
double coset quotient of all of `G`, not in `HeckeCoset Δ H₁ H₂`. -/

/-- **Functoriality of `HeckeCoset` in its triple.** Inclusions `Δ ≤ Δ'`, `H₁ ≤ H₁'` and

double cosets, never split them.

Compute with `map_mk`: the underlying element of `G` is unchanged, only retyped into `Δ'` by
`Submonoid.inclusion`. The functor laws are `map_id` and `map_map`; all three are `@[simp]`.
This widens subgroups inside one fixed ambient group — transporting a double coset along a

/-! ### Restriction to a smaller ambient group

`map` above moves a Hecke coset along inclusions *within a fixed* `G`. This moves one **between
ambient groups**: when the whole triple `(Δ, H₁, H₂)` lies inside a subgroup `H`, the double
cosets are the same sets read inside `↥H`, so the quotient is the same quotient.

Why it is wanted: a theorem quantified over the ambient group is applied along a homomorphism out
of that group, and the available homomorphisms are frequently defined only on a subgroup — the
motivating case being `TauCeti.ratPosToPSL2R`, whose source is `GL(2, ℚ)⁺`, while the Hecke cosets
of interest live in `GL (Fin 2) ℚ`. -/

/-- **Re-read a Hecke coset over a subgroup containing its whole triple.** With `Δ ≤ H`,
`H₁ ≤ H` and `H₂ ≤ H`, the double coset `H₁ g H₂` of `g : Δ` is a subset of `H`, and this is
that same double coset read in `↥H`.

Like `map`, this is induced on the quotient rather than defined through a chosen representative,
so `restrict_mk` is its defining equation. -/

`Γ₁ ⧸ (Γ₁ ∩ gΓ₂g⁻¹)` and `φ(Γ₁) ⧸ (φ(Γ₁) ∩ φ(g)φ(Γ₂)φ(g)⁻¹)` are in bijection, by `φ` on
representatives.

This is index transport along an injective map, and nothing more: it identifies the two
decomposition quotients, leaving the acting group unchanged. `G` and `G'` are arbitrary groups
here, with no action in sight.

It does **not** supply a fundamental-domain tiling, and the reason is specific to the modular
setting rather than general: there the target acts on `ℍ` through a matrix group modulo scalars, so
an injective `φ` retains `-I ∈ Γ₂`, whose image is a non-identity element acting trivially — and
`MeasureTheory.IsFundamentalDomain` then holds for no set of positive measure, its disjointness
being `Pairwise` over distinct group elements. `decompQuotientEquivMapOfKerInfLe` is the version for
that application: it drops injectivity for a kernel condition, which is what leaves room for a
faithful action downstream. -/

/-- **Shimura's covering identity for a product of double cosets** (§3.4). If `Γ₁ δ₁ Γ₂` is the
union of the right cosets `Γ₁ aᵢ` and `Γ₂ δ₂ Γ₃` is the union of the right cosets `Γ₂ bⱼ`, then
the pointwise product `Γ₁ δ₁ Γ₂ · Γ₂ δ₂ Γ₃` is the union of the right cosets `Γ₁ aᵢ bⱼ`.

The two double cosets splice because `Γ₂ Γ₂ = Γ₂`: an element of the product is `u v` with
`u ∈ Γ₁ δ₁ Γ₂` and `v ∈ Γ₂ δ₂ Γ₃`; writing `v = g bⱼ` with `g ∈ Γ₂` moves `g` into `u`, and `u g`
is again in `Γ₁ δ₁ Γ₂`, hence in some `Γ₁ aᵢ`.

⚠ The union is **not** disjoint, and the family `(i, j) ↦ Γ₁ aᵢ bⱼ` is in general far from
injective. Any repetitions here are right-coset collisions; this theorem neither counts them nor
identifies them with `DoubleCoset.multiplicity`, which uses left-coset representatives. The
identity supplies coverage only, exactly as
`doubleCoset_eq_iUnion_rightCosets_of_forall_exists` does for a single double coset. -/

`hh₂` is part of the statement rather than a side condition: the right-hand side names the class
`⟦⟨h₂, hh₂⟩⟧`. Membership is a `Prop`, so any proof of `h₂ ∈ Γ₂` names the same class. This is
the per-summand step behind Shimura's Proposition 3.37: right multiplication by an element of
`Γ₂` permutes the right cosets `Γ₁ aᵥ`, and a `Γ₁`-invariant summand does not see `γ₁`. -/

/-- **Two families of representatives of the same right cosets are matched by a bijection.**
If the cosets `Γ₁ aᵢ` are pairwise distinct and cover `Γ₁ D.out Γ₂`, then the index type `ι` is
matched with `DecompQuotient Γ₂ Γ₁ (D.out)⁻¹` — the index Shimura's decomposition sums over — by a
bijection `φ` carrying each `Γ₁ aᵢ` to `Γ₁ (rightCosetRep D (φ i))`.

This is pure coset bookkeeping. It identifies the two index sets compatibly with the cosets they
name, and only that: the matched representatives `aᵢ` and `rightCosetRep D (φ i)` differ by a
factor of `Γ₁`, so a summand that can see the representative still distinguishes them. Equating
two sums over the families needs, in addition, a summand depending only on the coset — for a
slash term, `HeckeRing.GL2.slash_eq_of_rightCoset_eq` on a `Γ₁`-invariant function; for a
representation, `Representation.comp_eq_of_rightCoset_eq`. -/

of the double coset be named by exactly `m` members of the family. Then `g i = v` for exactly
`m` indices `i`, whatever `v`.

The hypothesis counts indices by the coset they name and the conclusion counts them by their
image under `g`; the two agree because `rightCosetRep` names distinct cosets by distinct
elements (`op_rightCosetRep_smul_injective`).

Like `exists_bijective_rightCosetRep_smul_eq` this is pure coset bookkeeping. It is the counting
half of the multiplicity-weighted collapse of a sum over a family that names each right coset `m`
times: each fibre has `m` elements. Reaching `m •` a single operator needs the other half too —
that the terms on a fibre agree, which is what a summand depending only on the right coset
supplies. -/
