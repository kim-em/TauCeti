# The elliptic relator is sign-equivariant in its four indices

For an odd sequence `W : ℤ → R`, Mathlib's `IsEllipticNet.atomRel W a b c d` changes sign under a
transposition of its four arguments. Mathlib proves that for the three adjacent transpositions
(`IsEllipticNet.neg_atomRel₁₂`, `neg_atomRel₂₃`, `neg_atomRel₃₄`); this file extends it, by
inducting over the generators of `Equiv.Perm (Fin 4)`, to an arbitrary permutation:
`atomRelFin4 W (t ∘ σ) = sign σ • atomRelFin4 W t`.

This is **skew-symmetry, not alternation**, and the distinction is not pedantic here. `R` is an
arbitrary commutative ring, so `2` may be a zero divisor or vanish; the usual implication from
`f = -f` to `f = 0` is unavailable, and nothing below forces the relator to vanish when two indices
coincide. That vanishing is a separate fact, and it is Mathlib's: given `W 0 = 0`, each of the six
`IsEllipticNet.atomRel_same` lemmas has the shape `_ * W 0 * _`, hence is zero. The descent uses
both, from their two sources.

The point is that descent. Deducing the four-index relation from the one-index odd and even
recurrences works by ordering the four indices and shrinking the largest, which is only available
once the relation may be reordered freely — this file — and once repeated indices can be
discharged — Mathlib's `atomRel_same` family with `W 0 = 0`.

## Main definitions

* `IsEllipticNet.atomRelFin4`: `atomRel` with its four indices packaged as a `Fin 4`-tuple, the
  form an arbitrary permutation acts on.

## Main results

* `IsEllipticNet.atomRelFin4_perm`: `atomRelFin4 W (t ∘ σ) = sign σ • atomRelFin4 W t` for every
  `σ : Equiv.Perm (Fin 4)`. Note this is sign-equivariance, not alternation — see the header. The
  sign-cancelled orientation is one `rw [atomRelFin4_perm odd, ← mul_smul, Int.units_mul_self,
  one_smul]` away and is not stated here: it has no consumer until the descent slice, which is
  where it will land, next to the proof that uses it.

## Implementation notes

The three adjacent transpositions are the generators `Mathlib`'s
`Equiv.Perm.mclosure_swap_castSucc_succ` gives for `Perm (Fin 4)`, which is what makes the
induction in `atomRelFin4_perm` go through with exactly Mathlib's three `neg_atomRel` lemmas as its
base cases, each read through `neg_eq_iff_eq_neg`.

Those lemmas rest on `IsEllipticNet.neg_atom`, `-atom W a b = atom W b a`, which is where the
oddness of `W` enters; nothing else here needs a hypothesis on `W`.

## Provenance

Ported from D. K. Angdinata's `LutzNagell/EllipticDivisibilitySequence.lean` in AINTLIB
(`github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB`, Apache-2.0, `main` at `1c1c74664e40071c2c2165bc55ca2616a67ccd6b`),
declarations `relFin4` and `relFin4_perm`. The source's transpositions `rel₄_swap₀₁`,
`rel₄_swap₁₂`, `rel₄_swap₂₃` are not ported: Mathlib has them as `neg_atomRel₁₂`,
`neg_atomRel₂₃`, `neg_atomRel₃₄`, with the negation moved to the other side. The source's
`relFin4_perm'` — the sign-cancelled orientation — was **considered and not ported**: it has no
consumer until the descent slice, and lands there beside `rel₄_of_oddRec_evenRec`, the proof that
uses it. That file's header reads `Authors: David Kurniadi Angdinata`; following this
repository's convention for adapted material the upstream authorship is credited here rather than
in the copyright header. J. Xu is acknowledged for the surrounding LutzNagell development — he
authors `Universal.lean` and co-authors `DivisionPolynomialOmega.lean` at the same revision — as
context for this port, not as an author of the declarations above.

Restated over Mathlib's names for this API: the source's `rel₄` is `IsEllipticNet.atomRel` and its
`addMulSub` is `IsEllipticNet.atom`, and the source's standing `neg : ∀ k, W (-k) = -W k` hypothesis
is Mathlib's `W.Odd`. Mathlib numbers the transpositions from one rather than from zero as the
source does, so the source's `rel₄_swap₀₁` is `neg_atomRel₁₂`, and so on.
