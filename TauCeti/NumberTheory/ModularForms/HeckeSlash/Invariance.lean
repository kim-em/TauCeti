# The slash sum of a `Γ₁`-invariant function is `Γ₂`-invariant

`heckeSlashSum` is a sum over *chosen* coset representatives, and `HeckeSlash/Basic.lean` records
that on a general `f : ℍ → ℂ` the value depends on those choices. This file proves the theorem
that repairs it: if `f` is invariant under the weight-`k` slash action of `Γ₁`, then
`heckeSlashSum k D f` is invariant under that of `Γ₂`.

That is the content of Shimura's Proposition 3.37 — right multiplication by `γ ∈ Γ₂` merely
**permutes** the right cosets `Γ₁ aᵥ` of the decomposition, so the sum is unchanged. Concretely
`aᵥ γ = δ τᵥ⁻¹ γ = δ (γ⁻¹ τᵥ)⁻¹`, so the permutation is `v ↦ γ⁻¹ • v` for the action of `Γ₂` on
`Γ₂ ⧸ (Γ₂ ∩ δ⁻¹Γ₁δ)` — `MulAction.toPerm` at `γ⁻¹` — and the per-summand step is
`slash_rightCosetRep_of_mem_right` from `HeckeSlash/Reindex.lean`.

⚠ The two groups are different: the hypothesis is invariance under `Γ₁` and the conclusion is
invariance under `Γ₂`. They agree on a diagonal triple `HeckeCoset Δ Γ Γ`, which is where the
Hecke operators of Layer 2(b) live, but nothing here needs them to.

## Main results

* `HeckeRing.GL2.heckeSlashSum_slash_invariant`: for `γ ∈ Γ₂` and `Γ₁`-invariant `f`,
  `heckeSlashSum k D f ∣[k] γ = heckeSlashSum k D f`.

## Provenance

The statement corresponds to `heckeSlash_slash_invariant` in the AINTLIB `LeanModularForms`
project ([`LeanModularForms/HeckeRIngs/GL2/HeckeAction.lean`](https://github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB),
commit `2baa76f742bdb4fb8ee323fabba41203bd390e08`, Apache-2.0, Chris Birkbeck), lines 198–246,
together with its helper `tRep_mul_eq_transpose`. No code is transcribed: that proof permutes a
*left*-coset index by transposing, so it holds only where every group in sight is transpose-stable
— level one — while the argument below is Shimura's own and quantifies over `γ ∈ Γ₂` at an
arbitrary triple. As in `Reindex.lean`, invariance is carried under the rational slash action
rather than routed through a real subgroup, so AINTLIB's `mem_SL_exists_H` bridge is not needed.

/-- **The slash sum of a `Γ₁`-invariant function is `Γ₂`-invariant.** For `f` invariant under the
weight-`k` slash action of `Γ₁` and `γ ∈ Γ₂`,
`heckeSlashSum k D f ∣[k] γ = heckeSlashSum k D f`.

The proof is Shimura's — right multiplication by `γ` permutes the summands — and the permutation
is `MulAction.toPerm` applied to `γ⁻¹`, acting on the right-coset index `Γ₂ ⧸ (Γ₂ ∩ δ⁻¹Γ₁δ)`.

⚠ This proves invariance of the sum formed from the representatives `D.out` and `v.out` that
`heckeSlashSum` fixes. That sums formed from *different* choices of representatives agree is a
separate theorem, `heckeSlashSum_eq_sum_of_rightCosets` in `HeckeSlash/Independence.lean`. -/
