# The slash sum over a double-coset decomposition

A Hecke operator acts on a modular form by slashing it against representatives of the double
coset and summing. This file defines that sum. It is unconditionally *additive* in `f` and kills
`0`; homogeneity — and so `ℂ`-linearity — additionally needs the representatives to have positive
determinant, because the scalar passes through the slash only on that branch.

## Which cosets the representatives run over

Shimura decomposes `Γ₁ δ Γ₂ = ⊔ᵥ Γ₁ aᵥ` — the group on the **left** — and sets
`f ∣[Γ₁ δ Γ₂]ₖ = ∑ᵥ f ∣[k] aᵥ` (§3.4, (3.4.1)). That handedness is what a *right* action needs:
right multiplication by `γ ∈ Γ₂` permutes the right cosets `Γ₁ aᵥ` among themselves, which is the
proof of his Proposition 3.37, and the invariance that makes the sum independent of the chosen
representatives is invariance of `f` under `Γ₁`.

Mathlib's `DoubleCoset.DecompQuotient Γ₁ Γ₂ δ` indexes the *left* cosets `σᵢ δ Γ₂` instead. The
right cosets are indexed by the mirror quotient `DecompQuotient Γ₂ Γ₁ δ⁻¹ = Γ₂ ⧸ (Γ₂ ∩ δ⁻¹Γ₁δ)`:
`Γ₁ δ τ = Γ₁ δ τ'` exactly when `δ τ' τ⁻¹ δ⁻¹ ∈ Γ₁`, that is when `τ` and `τ'` have the same class
there. The representative attached to a class `v` is `δ · (τᵥ)⁻¹`, the inverse appearing because
`Γ₂ ⧸ (Γ₂ ∩ δ⁻¹Γ₁δ)` is a quotient by *left* cosets while `Γ₁ δ τ` is constant along right ones;
`v ↦ γ⁻¹ • v` is then the permutation right multiplication by `γ` induces. That these
representatives do run over the right cosets, each exactly once, is
`DoubleCoset.doubleCoset_eq_iUnion_rightCosets` together with
`DoubleCoset.op_mul_out_inv_smul_injective` (`HeckeRing/Basic.lean`).

⚠ **It is not yet an action, and on a general `f : ℍ → ℂ` it is not even well defined.**
`heckeSlashSum` is a sum over *chosen* representatives — `D.out` for the double coset and `v.out`
for each of its right cosets — and on an arbitrary function the choice changes the answer. A
different representative of the same right coset is `γ₁ · (δ τᵥ⁻¹)` for some `γ₁ ∈ Γ₁`, and
`f ∣[k] (γ₁ x) = (f ∣[k] γ₁) ∣[k] x`, so the summand moves unless the slash by `γ₁` is trivial on
`f`. Even the identity double coset can therefore send a raw `f` to `f ∣[k] γ₁` rather than to `f`.
What repairs it is slash-invariance of `f` under `Γ₁`, and that is `HeckeSlash/Reindex.lean`;
`HeckeSlash/Invariance.lean` then turns it into invariance of the sum under `Γ₂`, and
`HeckeSlash/Independence.lean` into independence of the sum from every one of those choices.

⚠ Conventions: `gH` is a left coset and `Hg` a right one, as in Mathlib and in
`LeftCosetModule/Basic.lean`. AINTLIB's `HeckeAction.lean` uses the opposite labels for the same
objects; the mathematics is identical, the words are not.

## An arbitrary triple, and what each declaration actually needs

The declarations are stated over an arbitrary triple `HeckeCoset Δ Γ₁ Γ₂` rather than the
level-one pair `(posDetInt 2, SLnZ 2, SLnZ 2)`, and each carries only what it uses. Nothing is
asked of `Δ` at all beyond containing the chosen `δ`. In particular no group here has to be
stable under transposition, which is what confines the *left*-coset indexing to level one and is
why this file does not use it: `!![1, 1; 0, 1] ∈ Γ₁(N)` for every `N` while its transpose lies in
`Γ₁(N)` only when `N = 1`.

* `rightCosetRep` and its characteristic equation need only the group law.
* The **sum** and its additivity and vanishing on `0` need only that the index type is finite,
  so they take `[Finite (DecompQuotient Γ₂ Γ₁ δ⁻¹)]` directly — the proposition, not the
  data-bearing `Fintype`, since no chosen enumeration is used; the `Fintype` that `∑` needs is
  installed once as a local instance. A Hecke triple supplies that finiteness
  (`IsHeckeTriple.commensurable_conjAct_inv_left`, `HeckeRing/Basic.lean`) and is strictly
  stronger — it also demands commensurability and that `Δ` commensurate `Γ₁`, none of which the
  sum uses.
* Positivity of the determinant enters exactly once, in **homogeneity**: on the positive branch
  the slash action's conjugation `σ` is trivial and scalars commute past it
  (`ModularForm.rat_smul_slash_of_det_pos`), whereas over a general `GL(2, ℚ)`-element the twist
  is complex conjugation and linearity would fail. So `det_rightCosetRep_pos` and
  `heckeSlashSum_smul` — and only those — mention determinants, and each asks for the weakest
  form it can. (That the representatives lie in `posDetInt 2` when `δ` and `Γ₂` do is the general
  `DoubleCoset.rightCosetRep_mem` at that submonoid.) `det_rightCosetRep_pos` concludes a
  statement about determinants alone, so it asks only `Γ₂ ≤ GLPos (Fin 2) ℚ` and
  `δ ∈ GLPos (Fin 2) ℚ`.
  `heckeSlashSum_smul` asks less still: not a condition on the factors but
  `∀ v, 0 < det (rightCosetRep D v)`, since a product can be positive with neither factor
  positive and a factorwise hypothesis would exclude those cases. `det_rightCosetRep_pos` is how
  callers supply it. Neither `Γ₁` nor the rest of `Δ` is constrained anywhere.

## Main definitions

* `DoubleCoset.rightCosetRep` (in `NumberTheory/HeckeRing/Basic.lean`): the representative
  `δ τᵥ⁻¹` of the `v`-th right coset. Pure group theory, so it lives with the decomposition API.
* `HeckeRing.GL2.heckeSlashSum`: the choice-dependent sum `∑ᵥ f ∣[k] (δ τᵥ⁻¹)`.

## Main results

* `DoubleCoset.rightCosetRep_def`, `HeckeRing.GL2.heckeSlashSum_def` and
  `HeckeRing.GL2.heckeSlashSum_apply`: the characteristic equations, which are the interface
  since neither definition is `@[expose]`. The last two are the function-level and pointwise
  forms of the same equation.
* `HeckeRing.GL2.det_rightCosetRep_pos`: the representatives have positive determinant, given
  `Γ₂ ≤ GLPos (Fin 2) ℚ` and `δ ∈ GLPos (Fin 2) ℚ`.
* `HeckeRing.GL2.heckeSlashSum_add` and `heckeSlashSum_zero`: additivity and vanishing on `0`,
  with no hypothesis beyond finiteness of the index type.
* `HeckeRing.GL2.heckeSlashSum_smul`: homogeneity, which additionally needs each representative
  to have positive determinant — the hypothesis is that, not the factorwise condition, since a
  product can be positive with neither factor positive. `det_rightCosetRep_pos` supplies it.
  Together with `heckeSlashSum_add` this gives `ℂ`-linearity.

## Provenance

The definition and its additivity, zero and scalar lemmas correspond to `heckeSlash` and its
algebraic API in the AINTLIB `LeanModularForms` project
([`LeanModularForms/HeckeRIngs/GL2/HeckeAction.lean`](https://github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB),
commit `2baa76f742bdb4fb8ee323fabba41203bd390e08`, Apache-2.0, Chris Birkbeck). No code is
transcribed: AINTLIB indexes the sum by Mathlib's left-coset `DecompQuotient` and repairs the
handedness with a transpose, a device that works only where every group in sight is stable under
transposition — level one. The sum below runs over Shimura's own right-coset index instead, so it
is stated over an arbitrary triple, with no transpose anywhere.

/-- The representatives have positive determinant, in the shape
`ModularForm.rat_smul_slash_of_det_pos` consumes.

This asks only for positivity, not for the integrality `posDetInt 2` also carries: the conclusion
is about determinants alone, and `det (δ τᵥ⁻¹) = det δ · det τᵥ⁻¹`. A `posDetInt` hypothesis is
converted by `posDetInt_le_glpos`.

Factorwise positivity is *sufficient*, not necessary — a product can be positive with neither
factor positive — so `heckeSlashSum_smul` takes the positivity of each representative directly
and this lemma is the convenient way to supply it. -/

the representatives of the decomposition of `Γ₁ δ Γ₂` into right cosets `Γ₁ aᵥ`. Up to the `det`
normalising factor already built into the slash action, this is Shimura's `f ∣[Γ₁ δ Γ₂]ₖ`
(§3.4, (3.4.1)).

⚠ The *definition* depends on the chosen representatives `D.out` and `v.out`, and on a general
`f : ℍ → ℂ` the value changes with them — see the module docstring. Invariance of `f` under
`Γ₁` is *sufficient* to make it independent of those choices: for such an `f` the sum is the
sum over any decomposition of `Γ₁ δ Γ₂` into right cosets whatsoever
(`heckeSlashSum_eq_sum_of_rightCosets`, `HeckeSlash/Independence.lean`), which is what makes the
operators built from it attached to the double coset. Whether invariance is also *necessary* is
not claimed here, since a particular `f` and `D` could be independent by cancellation.

⚠ Choice-independence is not the same as being an action, and this docstring does not claim the
latter. What right multiplication gives is invariance of the *output* under `Γ₂`, which is the
same group as the input's only on a diagonal triple. -/

Unlike additivity, this needs each representative to have positive determinant, because the
scalar passes through the slash only on that branch. That is asked for directly rather than
factorwise: `det (δ τᵥ⁻¹) > 0` is what the proof uses, and a product can be positive with neither
factor positive, so hypotheses on `Γ₂` and `δ` separately would exclude cases the theorem covers.
