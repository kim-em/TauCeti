# The Atkin–Lehner normalizing constant

The raw weight-`k` slash by an Atkin–Lehner matrix for a divisor `Q` of the level is not an
involution: the matrix squares to `Q` times an element of `Γ₀(N)`, so the slash squares to the
scalar `Q ^ (k - 2)`. The **arithmetic normalization** divides that away by multiplying the slash
by

`atkinLehnerNormalizer Q k = (√Q) ^ (2 - k)`,

whose square is `Q ^ (2 - k)` (`TauCeti.atkinLehnerNormalizer_sq`). The constant depends only on
the divisor and the weight, so it is isolated here, away from any modular form: the Fricke
operator — the member `Q = N` of the Atkin–Lehner family — is normalized by it just as the general
`𝒲_Q` is.

The square root is taken in `ℝ` and cast to `ℂ`, rather than as a complex power, so that no branch
of `(·) ^ (2 - k)` has to be chosen.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.atkinLehnerNormalizer`: the constant `(√Q) ^ (2 - k)`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.atkinLehnerNormalizer_sq`: it squares to `Q ^ (2 - k)`.
* `TauCeti.atkinLehnerNormalizer_sq_mul`: consequently it cancels the scalar `Q ^ (k - 2)` that
  the raw slash squares to.
* `TauCeti.atkinLehnerNormalizer_mul`: it is multiplicative in the divisor, which is what makes
  the normalized operators multiply the way the raw ones do.
* `TauCeti.atkinLehnerNormalizer_one`: at `Q = 1` it is `1`.

multiplied, so that the normalized operator squares to `1` rather than to `Q ^ (k - 2)`. -/

/-- `atkinLehnerNormalizer Q k` is nonzero, which is what makes the normalized operator a
bijection and lets the normalization be undone. -/

/-- **The normalization cancels the scalar the raw slash squares to.** Multiplying
`Q ^ (k - 2)` by the square of the normalizer leaves `1`; this single identity is the whole
arithmetic content of the normalization. -/

/-- **The normalizer is multiplicative in the divisor**, because the square root is: `√(Q R)` is
`√Q · √R`. This is what lets the composition law of the Atkin–Lehner operators be read off from
the composition law of the raw slashes. -/

the identity. -/
