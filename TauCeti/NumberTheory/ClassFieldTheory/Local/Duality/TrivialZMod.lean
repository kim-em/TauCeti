# Local Tate duality for modules with trivial action

Let `K` be a nonarchimedean local field containing a primitive `n`th root of unity `ζ`. This file
proves Tate's local duality with values in `ℤ/n` for every finite module killed by `n` on which
`G_K` acts trivially. It first treats the trivial module `ℤ/n` itself, proving that
the duality maps `αᵢ : Hⁱ(G_K, ℤ/n) → Hom(H²⁻ⁱ(G_K, Hom(ℤ/n, ℤ/n)), H²(G_K, ℤ/n))` in degrees `0`
and `1` (`TauCeti.ContCohomology.dualityMap0`, `dualityMap1`) are bijective, `α₂`
(`TauCeti.ContCohomology.dualityMap2`) being bijective for every group acting trivially. The root
`ζ` identifies the trivial coefficients `ℤ/n` with `μₙ`, so this is the duality of `μₙ` with itself,
and it is the base case from which local duality for a general finite module is reached by
Shapiro's lemma and the four lemma.

From `ℤ/n` the duality passes to every finite module `A` killed by `n` with trivial action
(`TauCeti.ClassFieldTheory.dualityMap0_bijective_of_isPrimitiveRoot` and its companions in degrees
`1` and `2`), by the dévissage of
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Homological/ContCohomology/Cup/Duality/TrivialAction.lean`: `A`
embeds into a free `ℤ/n`-module, along which the four lemma gives injectivity, and the injections
are bijections by counting, `H¹(G_K, ℤ/n)` being finite.

The arithmetic input is in degree `(1, 1)`: **the cup square on `H¹(G_K, ℤ/n)` is a perfect
pairing** (`TauCeti.ClassFieldTheory.cupFp_bijective_of_isPrimitiveRoot`). Through `ζ` it is the
cohomological Hilbert pairing along `kummerCupPairing ζ hζ`
(`TauCeti.ClassFieldTheory.muNRepCohomologyEquivTrivialFp_kummerCupPairing_cup`), which separates
the points of its second variable (`TauCeti.ClassFieldTheory.separatingRight_localSymbol`). By
graded commutativity (`TauCeti.cupFp_eq_zero_comm`) it separates those of its first variable too,
and `H¹(G_K, ℤ/n)` and its `ℤ/n`-linear maps to `H²(G_K, ℤ/n) ≃ ℤ/n` (`h2FpEquivZMod`) are finite
of the same order, so the injection `a ↦ (a ⌣ -)` is a bijection. In degrees `(0, 2)` and `(2, 0)`
the duality maps are scalar multiplication on `H²(G_K, ℤ/n) ≃ ℤ/n`; `α₂` is bijective for every
group acting trivially (`TauCeti.ContCohomology.dualityMap2_zmod_bijective`), and `α₀` because
`H²(G_K, ℤ/n)` is `ℤ/n` (`TauCeti.ContCohomology.dualityMap0_zmod_bijective_of_addEquiv`).

The duality maps are stated for any topological group `H` isomorphic to `G_K`, the form in which an
open subgroup of the absolute Galois group of a smaller field, fixing a finite extension `K`,
appears in Shapiro's lemma.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.ClassFieldTheory.cupFp_bijective_of_isPrimitiveRoot`: the cup square on
  `H¹(G_K, ℤ/n)` is a perfect pairing when `K` contains a primitive `n`th root of unity.
* `TauCeti.ClassFieldTheory.map₂_cupFp_absoluteGaloisGroup_eq_top_of_isPrimitiveRoot`: for a
  prime `p`, `H²(G_K, 𝔽_p)` is spanned by cup products of classes in `H¹(G_K, 𝔽_p)`.
* `TauCeti.ClassFieldTheory.dualityMap0_zmod_bijective_of_isPrimitiveRoot`,
  `TauCeti.ClassFieldTheory.dualityMap1_zmod_bijective_of_isPrimitiveRoot`: Tate's duality maps
  `α₀` and `α₁` at the trivial module `ℤ/n` are bijective, for any topological group isomorphic to
  `G_K`.
* `TauCeti.ClassFieldTheory.dualityMap0_bijective_of_isPrimitiveRoot`,
  `TauCeti.ClassFieldTheory.dualityMap1_bijective_of_isPrimitiveRoot`,
  `TauCeti.ClassFieldTheory.dualityMap2_bijective_of_isPrimitiveRoot`: Tate's duality maps with
  values in `ℤ/n` are bijective on every finite module killed by `n` with trivial action, for any
  topological group isomorphic to `G_K`.
