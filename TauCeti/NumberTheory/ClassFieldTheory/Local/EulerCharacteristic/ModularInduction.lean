# Modular induction for the local Euler characteristic

Let `F` be a finite extension of `ℚ_p` and `ℓ` a prime. Tate's local Euler characteristic formula
`χ_F(A) = φ_F(A)` for finite smooth discrete `ZMod ℓ`-representations `A` of `G_F` reduces to
representations inflated from a finite Galois quotient `G_F ⧸ V` and induced there from a cyclic
subgroup of order prime to `ℓ`.

Both sides descend to homomorphisms on the Grothendieck group of `(ZMod ℓ)[G_F ⧸ V]`
(`localEulerCharacteristicK0`, `localCardNormK0`) with torsion-free target, and by the modular
Artin induction theorem a positive multiple of every class is a sum of classes induced from such
cyclic subgroups (`TauCeti.eq_of_comp_indK0_eq_of_cyclic_coprime`). The induced classes are those
of the finite-dimensional induced representations `TauCeti.indFDRep`, so the formula for these
inflated induced representations gives it in general. By Shapiro's lemma these are in turn
computed over the fixed field of the cyclic subgroup, where the order of the acting group is prime
to `ℓ`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.ClassFieldTheory.localEulerCharacteristic_eq_localCardNorm_of_indFDRep`: the
  local Euler characteristic formula for every finite smooth discrete `ZMod ℓ`-representation
  follows from the formula for the inflations of representations induced from cyclic subgroups of
  order prime to `ℓ`.
