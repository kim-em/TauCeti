# Algebraic Hecke characters

A Hecke character is **algebraic** (of Weil type `A₀`) when its archimedean parameters agree
with those of integer exponents at the complex embeddings on the identity component.  Thus signs
at real places are deliberately ignored.  In particular every finite-order Hecke character is
algebraic, including characters with nontrivial real signs.

The unitary norm characters `c ↦ ‖c‖ ^ (it)` provide the basic separation from arbitrary
continuous Hecke characters.  When `t ≠ 0`, their archimedean modulus exponents are nonzero and
purely imaginary, so they are neither algebraic nor of finite order.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.GlobalNumberFields.HeckeCharacter.IsAlgebraic`: Weil's type `A₀` condition.
* `TauCeti.GlobalNumberFields.HeckeCharacter.normCharacter`: the unitary norm character
  `c ↦ ‖c‖ ^ (it)`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.GlobalNumberFields.HeckeCharacter.isAlgebraic_of_isFiniteOrder`: finite-order Hecke
  characters are algebraic.
* `TauCeti.GlobalNumberFields.HeckeCharacter.not_isAlgebraic_normCharacter`: a nontrivial unitary
  norm character is not algebraic.
* `TauCeti.GlobalNumberFields.HeckeCharacter.not_isFiniteOrder_normCharacter`: a nontrivial
  unitary norm character does not have finite order.
