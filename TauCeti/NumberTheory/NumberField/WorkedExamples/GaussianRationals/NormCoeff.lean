# The norm coefficient of `ℚ(i)` at `5`

For `K` generated over `ℚ` by an algebraic integer `θ` with `minpoly ℤ θ = X² + 1`, the ideals
of absolute norm `5` are `(2 + θ)` and `(2 − θ)`
(`TauCeti.NumberField.GaussianRationals.absNorm_eq_five_iff`). So the Dedekind zeta function of
`ℚ(i)` has coefficient `2` at `5`, where the Riemann zeta function has `1`, and regrouping the
trivial ideal weight by norm gives the coefficient `2` there.

This is the smallest witness that regrouping by norm has no pointwise-product formula: the
pointwise product `1 * 1` of the trivial function with itself is `1`, whose coefficient at `5` is
`2`, not `2 · 2`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.NumberField.GaussianRationals.dedekindZetaCoeff_five`: `ℚ(i)` has two integral
  ideals of absolute norm `5`.
* `TauCeti.NumberField.GaussianRationals.exists_normCoeff_eq_zero_not_forall_nonneg`: those two
  ideals carry a nonzero ideal arithmetic function with a negative value and vanishing norm
  coefficients.
Together with `TauCeti.normCoeff_one_apply` and
`TauCeti.not_forall_normCoeff_mul_eq_pmul`, this gives the trivial ideal weight's coefficient
at `5` and the failure of a pointwise-product formula over `ℚ(i)`.
