# Infinite places in a normal tower

For a tower `K ⊆ F ⊆ L` with `F / K` normal, restriction of automorphisms along
`AlgEquiv.restrictNormal` is compatible with the Galois action on infinite places: moving a
place of `L` by `σ` and then inducing a place of `F` gives the same place as inducing first and
then moving by the restricted automorphism.

The general tower API also identifies places over a fixed base place with pairs of successive
places through the intermediate field. Two consequences of the Galois-action compatibility are
recorded here too. A place of `F` induced by a place
of `L` ramified over `K` is itself ramified over `K` as soon as it stays complex, because both
places lie over the same place of `K`. And an automorphism restricting trivially to `F` is
itself trivial whenever it fixes a place that is unramified over `F`, because such a place has
trivial stabilizer in `Gal(L/F)`.

Nothing here mentions complex conjugation: these are general facts about the action on places,
used by `TauCeti/NumberTheory/NumberField/ComplexConjugation/Basic.lean`.

## Main results

* `AlgEquiv.restrictNormal_smul_comap`: the action is equivariant along the tower.
* `NumberField.InfinitePlace.liesOverTowerEquiv`: places over a fixed place correspond to pairs of
  successive places through an intermediate field.
* `TauCeti.NumberField.isRamified_comap_of_isComplex`: a complex induced place is itself ramified.
* `TauCeti.NumberField.eq_one_of_restrictNormal_eq_one`: an automorphism restricting trivially
  to `F` and fixing a place unramified over `F` is the identity.
