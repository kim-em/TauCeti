# The narrow-versus-ordinary defect of a quadratic field

For a number field `K` the sequence `Kˣ → Cl⁺(K) → Cl(K) → 1` is exact, so the defect between the
narrow and the ordinary class group is the image of the principal-class map `mkPrincipal`. That
image is a quotient of the group of sign patterns of `Kˣ` at the real places, modulo the global
sign, since `(x)` and `(-x)` are the same ideal. A quadratic field has at most two real places, so
the defect has at most two elements.

The quantitative statement proved here is sharper than a place count, and needs no case split on
the signature. Let `σ` be quadratic conjugation and let `x ∈ Kˣ`. The ratio `r = x / σx` has
`σ r = r⁻¹`, so `r / σ r = r²` is totally positive, and
`NumberField.isTotallyPositive_or_isTotallyPositive_neg_of_isTotallyPositive_div_quadraticConj`
puts `r` or `-r` on the totally positive side. In the first case the same lemma applied to `x`
makes `x` or `-x` totally positive, so `(x)` is narrowly trivial. In the second case the generator
`θ` absorbs the discrepancy: `σθ = -θ` gives `(θx) / σ(θx) = -r`, so `θx` or `-θx` is totally
positive and `[x]⁺ = [θ]⁺`. Hence every principal narrow class is `1` or `[θ]⁺`.

This bounds by one the amount by which the ordinary `2`-rank of a quadratic field can fall short
of the narrow `2`-rank `t - 1` computed by genus theory: for a real field the drop does happen,
as `ℚ(√3)` shows.

Whether the defect is trivial is decided by the units. A unit of norm `-1` scales every nonzero
element to a totally positive one
(`NumberField.exists_unit_isTotallyPositive_smul_of_norm_eq_neg_one`), so every principal narrow
class is trivial and `Cl⁺(K) → Cl(K)` is injective; the field is then
automatically real. Conversely, for a real field (`0 < d`), injectivity makes the narrow class of
`(θ)` trivial, so some `v · θ` is totally positive and has positive norm `N(v) · (-d)`, forcing
`N(v) = -1`. This is the classical criterion `h⁺ = h ↔ N(ε) = -1` for the fundamental unit `ε`. A
solution of the negative Pell equation `b² - d a² = -1` supplies such a unit
(`NumberField.exists_norm_eq_neg_one_of_sq_sub_mul_sq_eq_neg_one`): for `d = 2`, `a = b = 1` gives
`1 + √2`. For an imaginary field there is no unit of norm `-1`, and the two class groups agree for
the unrelated reason that positivity is vacuous
(`NumberField.NarrowClassGroup.toClassGroup_injective`).

## Main results

* `NumberField.mkPrincipal_eq_one_or_eq_mkPrincipal_gen`: a principal narrow class of a quadratic
  field is trivial or the narrow class of the generator.
* `NumberField.mkPrincipal_eq_mkPrincipal_gen_of_norm_neg`: a principal ideal with a generator of
  negative norm has the narrow class of the generator.
* `NumberField.card_ker_toClassGroup_le_two`: the kernel of `Cl⁺(K) → Cl(K)` has at most two
  elements.
* `NumberField.card_narrowClassGroup_le_two_mul_card_classGroup`: `h⁺(K) ≤ 2 h(K)`.
* `NumberField.NarrowClassGroup.toClassGroup_injective_of_norm_eq_neg_one`: a unit of norm `-1`
  makes `Cl⁺(K) → Cl(K)` injective.
* `NumberField.NarrowClassGroup.toClassGroup_injective_iff_exists_norm_eq_neg_one`: for `0 < d`
  the converse holds too.
* `NumberField.NarrowClassGroup.card_eq_card_classGroup_iff_exists_norm_eq_neg_one`: for `0 < d`
  the narrow class number equals the class number exactly when some unit has norm `-1`.

/-- **The principal narrow classes of a quadratic field are `1` and `[θ]⁺`.** For `K = ℚ(√d)`
presented by `θ` and any `x : Kˣ`, the narrow class of the principal ideal `(x)` is trivial or
equal to the narrow class of `(θ)`.

The ratio `r = x / σx` satisfies `σ r = r⁻¹`, so `r / σ r = r²` is totally positive and hence `r`
or `-r` is. If `r` is, then `x` or `-x` is totally positive and `(x)` is narrowly trivial. If `-r`
is, the same applies to `θx`, because `σθ = -θ` turns `(θx) / σ(θx)` into `-r`. -/
