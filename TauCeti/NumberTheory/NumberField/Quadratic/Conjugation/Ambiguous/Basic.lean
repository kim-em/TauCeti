# Ambiguous ideals of a quadratic field

An ideal of `𝓞 K` is *ambiguous* when quadratic conjugation `σ` fixes it, `σI = I`; an ideal class
is *ambiguous* when `σ` fixes it, which for a quadratic field means exactly that the class is
`2`-torsion (`NumberField.mulEquiv_ringOfIntegersQuadraticConj_apply_eq_self_iff`, since `σ` acts by
inversion). Every ambiguous ideal obviously has an ambiguous class. This file proves the converse
for an **imaginary** quadratic field: every ambiguous class is the class of an ambiguous ideal, so
the two notions of "ambiguous" match up:

`C ^ 2 = 1 ↔ ∃ I, σI = I ∧ [I] = C`.

This is the descent step of the classical *ambiguous class number formula*, which counts the
`2`-torsion of `Cl(𝓞 K)`: it replaces a count of ambiguous **classes** by a count of ambiguous
**ideals**. The remaining step of that count — that the class of an ambiguous ideal is a product of
classes of ramified primes, which in turn satisfy the relation `∏ 𝔭 = (θ)` of
`TauCeti.Multiquadratic.span_singleton_eq_prod_primeFactors` — is
`NumberField.classGroupMk0_mem_closure_of_map_eq_self` in
`Quadratic/Conjugation/Ambiguous/Ideal.lean`; the two together give the genus-theoretic bound
`2-rank ≤ t - 1` of the Multiquadratic roadmap.

The proof is Hilbert's Theorem 90 for the quadratic extension `K/ℚ`, in the elementary form
available for a degree-two extension. If `[σJ] = [J]` then `(x) σJ = (y) J` for nonzero
`x y : 𝓞 K`; conjugating and cancelling gives `(x σx) = (y σy)`, so `x σx` and `y σy` are
associates. The unit relating them has norm the square of the rational `N(y) / N(x)`, and in a
**totally complex** field total positivity is vacuous, so the norm of a nonzero element is strictly
positive (`NumberField.norm_pos_of_isTotallyPositive`), which forces `x σx = y σy` on the nose.
Hilbert 90 then produces `ε ≠ 0` with `x ε = y σε`, and `I = (ε) J` is an ambiguous ideal in `J`'s
class. For a *real* quadratic field the positivity fails — that is exactly where the classical
unit index `[E : E ∩ N K^×]` enters the ambiguous class number formula — so the hypothesis
`IsTotallyComplex K` is essential rather than technical. The repair is to pass to the **narrow**
class group, where total positivity restores the sign for every quadratic field; see
`Quadratic/Conjugation/Ambiguous/Narrow.lean`.

The integral Hilbert 90 result used below is proved in `Quadratic.Conjugation.Hilbert90`.

For a quadratic field of either signature, this file also defines a *strongly ambiguous class* to
be an ordinary ideal class represented by an ambiguous ideal. The definition and its basic API do
not require the totally complex hypothesis; only the converse from an ambiguous class to an
ambiguous ideal does.

See F. Lemmermeyer, *Reciprocity Laws: From Euler to Eisenstein*, §2.2, whose Proposition 2.9 is
the statement proved here, and D. A. Cox, *Primes of the Form x² + ny²*, §6.A, for the classical
ambiguous class number formula.

## Main results

* `NumberField.mul_ringOfIntegersQuadraticConj_eq_mul_ringOfIntegersQuadraticConj_of_associated`:
  associated norms with a positive norm product are equal, the archimedean input to the descent.
* `NumberField.exists_map_ringOfIntegersQuadraticConj_eq_self_of_sq_eq_one`: a `2`-torsion ideal
  class of an imaginary quadratic field is the class of an ambiguous ideal.
* `NumberField.classGroupMk0_sq_eq_one_of_map_ringOfIntegersQuadraticConj_eq_self`: conversely, the
  class of an ambiguous ideal is `2`-torsion.
* `NumberField.IsStronglyAmbiguousClass`: an ordinary ideal class is strongly ambiguous when it is
  represented by an ideal fixed by quadratic conjugation.
* `NumberField.stronglyAmbiguousClassSubgroup`: the subgroup of strongly ambiguous ordinary ideal
  classes.
* `NumberField.sq_eq_one_iff_exists_map_ringOfIntegersQuadraticConj_eq_self`: the ambiguous classes
  are exactly the classes of ambiguous ideals.
* `Ideal.map_map_of_involutive`: pushing an ideal forward twice along an involutive ring
  automorphism returns it.

/-- **Two elements with associated norms and positive norm product have equal norms.** If
`x σx` and `y σy` are associates in `𝓞 K` and the norm of `x y` is positive, then `x σx = y σy`:
their ratio is a unit whose norm is the square of the rational `N(y) / N(x)`, so `N(x) = ± N(y)`,
and the sign is fixed by `0 < N(x) N(y)`.

This is where the archimedean input enters the ambiguous class number formula. For a totally complex
field the norm of a nonzero element is automatically positive; for a real quadratic field the
positivity has to come from total positivity of `x y`, which is what the *narrow* class group
supplies. -/
