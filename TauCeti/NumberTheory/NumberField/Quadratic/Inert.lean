# A conjugation-stable prime over an unramified rational prime is inert

Let `K` be a number field of degree `2` over `ℚ`. Such a field is Galois by Mathlib's
`Algebra.IsQuadraticExtension.isGalois` instance, and its Galois group has order `2`.
Consequently the two elements of that group act on the primes of `𝓞 K` above a rational prime `p`
transitively, and a prime `𝔭` above `p` fixed by the nontrivial automorphism is the *only* prime
above `p`.

Adding that `p` is unramified turns that into

`p 𝓞 K = 𝔭`,

so `p` is inert and `𝔭` is principal. Together with the ramified case
(`TauCeti.NumberTheory.NumberField.Quadratic.TotalRamification`, where `p 𝓞 K = 𝔭 ^ 2`) this
disposes of every prime that quadratic conjugation fixes: it is either principal, or one of the
finitely many primes above a ramified rational prime. That dichotomy is what makes the classes of
the ramified primes generate the ambiguous ideal classes of `K` in
`TauCeti.NumberTheory.NumberField.Quadratic.Conjugation.Ambiguous.Ideal`, the descent step of the
ambiguous class number formula of genus theory.

The automorphism is supplied as a `ℚ`-algebra automorphism `f` of `K` together with a ring
automorphism `σ` of `𝓞 K` restricting it; that is the shape in which
`NumberField.ringOfIntegersQuadraticConj` and `NumberField.coe_ringOfIntegersQuadraticConj` present
quadratic conjugation.

See D. A. Cox, *Primes of the Form x² + ny²*, §6.A, and F. Lemmermeyer, *Reciprocity Laws: From
Euler to Eisenstein*, §2.2, for the classical genus theory in which this dichotomy is used.

## Main results

* `NumberField.primesOver_eq_singleton_of_map_eq_self`: a prime fixed by the nontrivial
  automorphism is the unique prime above the rational prime it lies over.
* `NumberField.map_span_eq_of_notMem_ramifiedPrimes`: if that rational prime is moreover
  unramified, then `p 𝓞 K = 𝔭`, so `𝔭` is principal.
