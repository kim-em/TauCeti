# Primitive actions from blocks and chains of blocks

For a transitive group action, the blocks containing a chosen point are order-isomorphic to the
subgroups containing its stabilizer. This file applies that correspondence at the two ends of the
block lattice, and then along a chain of blocks.

A minimal non-singleton block gives a primitive action of its setwise stabilizer on the block.
A maximal proper block gives a maximal subgroup of the original group, and hence a primitive
action of the original group on the translates of the block. These are different actions: the
first resolves the action inside one block, while the second passes to the induced block system.

Both are ends of one statement. Covering relations among blocks containing `a` are exactly the
covering relations among their stabilizers, so the maximal chains of blocks `{a} = B₀ ⋖ ⋯ ⋖ Bₖ = X`
correspond to the maximal chains of subgroups from the stabilizer of `a` to `G` (as flags, this is
`Flag.map (MulAction.block_stabilizerOrderIso G a)`). At a step `Bᵢ ⋖ Bᵢ₊₁` the stabilizer of
`Bᵢ₊₁` acts primitively on the translates of `Bᵢ` contained in `Bᵢ₊₁`, and the cardinality of
`X` is the product of the degrees of these primitive actions. This is the chain of imprimitivity
along which a transitive group is built from primitive pieces.

## Main results

* `MulAction.IsBlock.isAtom_iff_stabilizer_covBy`: atomicity of a block is equivalent to its
  stabilizer covering the point stabilizer.
* `MulAction.IsBlock.isPreprimitive_stabilizer_of_isAtom`: the stabilizer of an atomic block acts
  primitively on that block.
* `MulAction.IsBlock.isCoatom_iff_isCoatom_stabilizer`: a block is coatomic exactly when its
  stabilizer is a maximal subgroup.
* `MulAction.IsBlock.isPreprimitive_orbit_of_isCoatom`: the action on the translates of a
  coatomic block is primitive.
* `MulAction.BlockMem.covBy_iff_stabilizer_covBy`: a block covers another exactly when its
  stabilizer covers the other's.
* `MulAction.IsBlock.mem_orbit_stabilizer_iff`: the translates of `B` by the stabilizer of a block
  `C ⊇ B` are the translates of `B` contained in `C`.
* `MulAction.BlockMem.isPreprimitive_stabilizer_orbit_of_covBy`: for blocks `B₁ ⋖ B₂`, the
  stabilizer of `B₂` acts primitively on the translates of `B₁` that it contains.
* `MulAction.BlockMem.natCard_eq_prod_ncard_orbit_stabilizer`: along a chain of blocks from `{a}`
  to `X`, the cardinality of `X` is the product of the numbers of translates at each step.

Minimality is expressed by saying that `B` is an atom of `MulAction.BlockMem G a`. The bottom
element of this order is the singleton `{a}`, so atomicity also supplies the nontriviality of the
type `B` required by the point-stabilizer criterion for primitivity. -/

/-! ### Chains of blocks

Between the two extremal cases sits the general step. If `B ⋖ C` in the lattice of blocks
containing `a`, the setwise stabilizer of `C` permutes the translates of `B` contained in `C`, and
this action is primitive. Iterating along a chain `{a} = B 0 ⋖ B 1 ⋖ ⋯ ⋖ B k = X` of blocks
resolves the action into a tower of primitive actions, and the degree of the action is the product
of their degrees. -/

stabilizer of the first covers that of the second in the subgroup lattice. -/
