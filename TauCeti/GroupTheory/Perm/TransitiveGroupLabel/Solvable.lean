# Solvable transitive subgroups of the symmetric groups of degree at most five

This file determines the solvability column of the table of transitive groups of degree at most
five. In degree at most four every reference subgroup is solvable, because the whole symmetric
group on at most four points is (Mathlib's `Equiv.Perm.isSolvable`). In degree five the labels
`5T1`, `5T2` and `5T3` are solvable, while `5T4 = A₅` and `5T5 = S₅` are not.

The solvable transitive subgroups of `Equiv.Perm (Fin 5)` are precisely the subgroups conjugate
into the Frobenius group `5T3` of order twenty.  The forward implication uses the classification
of transitive subgroups: `5T1`, `5T2`, and `5T3` lie in `5T3`, while `5T4 = A₅` and
`5T5 = S₅` are not solvable.  The reverse implication follows because `5T3` is solvable.

The solvability of `5T3` comes from its normal cyclic subgroup `5T1` of order five.  The quotient
has order four, hence is commutative, so both the subgroup and quotient are solvable.

Solvability of a permutation group with a transitive-group label depends only on the label
(`TauCeti.TransitiveGroupLabel.isSolvable_iff`), so the table applies to every transitive
subgroup of degree at most five.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.isSolvable_referenceSubgroup_five_iff`: exactly `5T1`, `5T2`, and `5T3` are solvable.
* `TauCeti.isSolvable_referenceSubgroup_iff`: the solvability column of the table of transitive
  groups of degree at most five.
* `TauCeti.TransitiveGroupLabel.isSolvable_iff_ne_five_or_lt_three`: a permutation group with a
  label is solvable unless its label is `5T4` or `5T5`.
* `TauCeti.isSolvable_iff_exists_le_map_conj_referenceSubgroup_five_two`: a transitive subgroup
  of `S₅` is solvable exactly when it is contained in a conjugate of `5T3`.
