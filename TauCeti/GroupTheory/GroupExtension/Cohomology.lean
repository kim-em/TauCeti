# Factor sets up to cohomology are the second cohomology group

A factor set `α : FactorSet G M` is by definition a normalized multiplicative `2`-cocycle, so it
has a class in `H²(G, M) = groupCohomology.H2 (Rep.ofMulDistribMulAction G M)`. This file builds
that class and proves that it is a *complete* invariant of `α` modulo coboundaries: the map

`FactorSet G M ⧸ (cohomologous) → H²(G, M)`

is a bijection (`TauCeti.FactorSet.cohomologyClassEquiv`). Both halves need an argument. Two factor
sets have the same class exactly when their quotient is a coboundary — the interesting direction
here is that a coboundary witnessing this is automatically normalized, so no compatibility with the
normalization of `α` and `β` has to be arranged. And every class is the class of a factor set: an
arbitrary `2`-cocycle need not be normalized, but dividing it by the coboundary of the constant
function `f (1, 1)` normalizes it without moving its class
(`TauCeti.FactorSet.ofIsMulCocycle₂`).

Read through the group extensions of `TauCeti/GroupTheory/GroupExtension/Of/FactorSet.lean` and
`TauCeti/GroupTheory/GroupExtension/FactorSetOfSection.lean`, this says several things about
extensions of `G` by an abelian kernel `M` inducing the given action: the class read off an
extension does not depend on the normalized section it is read from
(`TauCeti.GroupExtension.cohomologyClass_factorSet_eq`) and is unchanged by an equivalence of
extensions, and two such extensions are equivalent exactly when their classes agree
(`TauCeti.GroupExtension.nonempty_equiv_iff_cohomologyClass_factorSet_eq`), so the class is a
complete invariant of the extension. The class vanishes exactly on the split extensions.
Specializing the action to the trivial action of `G` on
`M = kˣ` gives `H²(G, kˣ)`, the group that classifies the factor sets of projective representations
of `G`, equivalently the central extensions of `G` by `kˣ` up to equivalence.

## Universes

`Rep ℤ G` puts the group and the module in the universe of `ℤ`, so the whole file is stated for
`G M : Type`. This is the same restriction Mathlib's own multiplicative interface to
`groupCohomology.cocycles₂` carries; `FactorSet G M` itself is universe-polymorphic and stays so.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.FactorSet.toCocycles₂`: a factor set read as a `2`-cocycle valued in `Additive M`.
* `TauCeti.FactorSet.cohomologyClass`: its class in `H²(G, M)`.
* `TauCeti.FactorSet.IsCohomologous`: two factor sets whose quotient is a multiplicative
  `2`-coboundary, with `TauCeti.FactorSet.isCohomologousSetoid` the equivalence relation it cuts
  out, presented as the kernel of the cohomology class.
* `TauCeti.FactorSet.ofIsMulCocycle₂`: the normalization of an arbitrary multiplicative
  `2`-cocycle.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.FactorSet.cohomologyClass_eq_iff`: two factor sets have the same class exactly when they
  are cohomologous.
* `TauCeti.FactorSet.exists_cohomologyClass_eq`: every class in `H²(G, M)` is the class of a factor
  set.
* `TauCeti.FactorSet.cohomologyClassEquiv`: **`H²(G, M)` classifies factor sets up to cohomology.**
* `TauCeti.FactorSet.cohomologyClass_eq_zero_iff` and
  `TauCeti.FactorSet.nonempty_splitting_iff_cohomologyClass_eq_zero`: the class vanishes exactly
  for the coboundaries, equivalently for the factor sets whose extension splits.
* `TauCeti.FactorSet.nsmul_cohomologyClass_eq_zero_iff`: `n` kills a factor-set class exactly
  when the pointwise `n`-th power of the factor set is a multiplicative coboundary.
* `TauCeti.FactorSet.exists_rescale_pow_eq_one`: with a surjective `n`-th power map for
  nonzero `n`, a class killed by `n` admits a normalized rescaling by an action-aware
  coboundary whose values have `n`-th power one. For `n = 0`, no divisibility is needed.
* `TauCeti.FactorSet.exists_cohomologyClass_eq_and_pow_eq_one`: the rescaling produces a
  cohomologous factor-set representative with pointwise `n`-th power one under the same
  hypotheses, allowing torsion classes to be represented by root-valued factor sets.
* `TauCeti.GroupExtension.cohomologyClass_factorSet_eq`: the class of the factor set of a
  normalized section does not depend on the section.
* `TauCeti.GroupExtension.nonempty_equiv_iff_cohomologyClass_factorSet_eq`: **`H²(G, M)` classifies
  group extensions of `G` by `M` inducing the given action, up to equivalence.**
