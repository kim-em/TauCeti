# Auditable finite group presentations

This file packages a finite group presentation together with the metadata needed to audit a
transcription from a published source. The generator-name list alone fixes the relator index type
to `Fin generatorNames.length`, so the relator arity cannot disagree with the generator names. The
generator and relator counts stated by the source are separate metadata, checked against the
transcribed data by `TauCeti.GroupPresentation.matchesMetadata`.

The stored relators are human-readable `TauCeti.Relator` expressions. They are compiled to
Mathlib's signed words and then interpreted by `FreeGroup.mk`; the resulting finite list of
relations, regarded as a set, defines `TauCeti.GroupPresentation.Group` using Mathlib's
`PresentedGroup`.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.GroupPresentation`: cited presentation data and its transcription metadata.
* `TauCeti.GroupPresentation.relators`: the compiled signed words.
* `TauCeti.GroupPresentation.relatorLetters`: the compiled words with generator indices as naturals,
  for stating a letter-by-letter comparison with a source.
* `TauCeti.GroupPresentation.totalLength`: the number of letters in the compiled words, for checking
  against a published presentation length.
* `TauCeti.GroupPresentation.relatorsCyclicallyReduced`: the decidable check that every compiled
  word is cyclically reduced.
* `TauCeti.GroupPresentation.relatorSet`: the relations as free-group elements.
* `TauCeti.GroupPresentation.Group`: the group defined by the presentation.
* `TauCeti.GroupPresentation.homEquiv`: homomorphisms specified by satisfying generator assignments.
* `TauCeti.GroupPresentation.matchesMetadata`: the decidable generator and relator count check.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.GroupPresentation.relatorSet_eq_relatorSet_transcribed`: the relations of a presentation
  are the relator set of its transcribed expressions.

/-- A finite group presentation together with auditable source and transcription metadata.

The source must be a full presentation of the abstract group, not a semi-presentation for
recognizing generators in a group already constructed elsewhere. `generatorNames` alone determines
the relator arity; `expectedGeneratorCount` is retained only as metadata checked by
`matchesMetadata`.

There is deliberately no checksum field: without a pinned normalization and algorithm, a checksum
would not be a reproducible check on the transcribed expressions. -/

def relators (P : GroupPresentation) : List (PresentationWord (Fin P.generatorCount)) :=
  P.transcribed.map Relator.toWord

/-- The compiled relators are obtained by compiling each transcribed expression.

This is the unfolding lemma for `TauCeti.GroupPresentation.relators`, whose body is sealed. It is
deliberately not `@[simp]`: the simp normal form of a presentation is the structural description
given by `length_relators` and `mem_relators_iff` below, not the compiled list. -/

    w ∈ P.relators ↔ ∃ t ∈ P.transcribed, t.toWord = w := by
  simp [relators]

/-- The compiled relator words, with each generator index displayed as a natural number.

A transcription is audited by comparing the compiled letters with the published relators, and this
form of them is the one to state such a comparison against: the index type of a word depends on the
generator-name list, whereas the letters here do not, so the comparison needs no arithmetic on that
dependency. -/
def relatorLetters (P : GroupPresentation) : List (List (ℕ × Bool)) :=
  P.relators.map (List.map fun letter => (letter.1.val, letter.2))

/-- The displayed letters are obtained by forgetting the bounds on the compiled generator
indices. This is the unfolding lemma for the sealed body, and like `relators_def` it is not
`@[simp]`. -/
theorem relatorLetters_def (P : GroupPresentation) :
    P.relatorLetters = P.relators.map (List.map fun letter => (letter.1.val, letter.2)) := by
  rw [relatorLetters]

/-- The total number of letters in the compiled relator words.

Sources for finite presentations customarily publish this figure, usually calling it the length of
the presentation, so comparing it with the transcribed data is a third decidable check on a
transcription alongside the two counts of `TauCeti.GroupPresentation.matchesMetadata`. A published
length is normally measured after free and cyclic reduction of each relator, so a row using it as a
check should also record that its compiled words are reduced. -/
def totalLength (P : GroupPresentation) : ℕ := (P.relators.map List.length).sum

/-- The total length is the sum of the lengths of the compiled relator words. This is the unfolding
lemma for the sealed body, and like `relators_def` it is not `@[simp]`. -/
theorem totalLength_def (P : GroupPresentation) :
    P.totalLength = (P.relators.map List.length).sum := by
  rw [totalLength]

/-- The displayed letter words have the same lengths as the compiled relator words, since
forgetting the bounds on the generator indices does not change a word's length.

A row that spells its compiled words out letter by letter therefore gets its per-relator length
check from that one comparison, rather than by unfolding the relator compiler a second time. -/
theorem map_length_relatorLetters (P : GroupPresentation) :
    P.relatorLetters.map List.length = P.relators.map List.length := by
  simp [relatorLetters_def, List.map_map, Function.comp_def]

/-- The total length is also the sum of the lengths of the displayed letter words. -/
theorem sum_map_length_relatorLetters (P : GroupPresentation) :
    (P.relatorLetters.map List.length).sum = P.totalLength := by
  rw [map_length_relatorLetters, totalLength_def]

/-- Every compiled relator word of a presentation is cyclically reduced.

A published presentation length is normally measured after free and cyclic reduction of each
relator, so this is what makes `TauCeti.GroupPresentation.totalLength` comparable with such a
figure. It is a check on the transcribed data only, and says nothing about the presented group. -/

    P.relatorsCyclicallyReduced ↔ ∀ w ∈ P.relators, FreeGroup.IsCyclicallyReduced w :=
  Iff.rfl

does not cancel against its first, and both halves of that are decidable. -/

def relatorSet (P : GroupPresentation) : Set (FreeGroup (Fin P.generatorCount)) :=

/-- The relations are exactly the free-group elements denoted by the transcribed expressions.

This is stated against `Relator.toFreeGroup` rather than against the compiled words, so a consumer
discharging the relations of `PresentedGroup` never has to unfold the compiler. -/
@[simp]
theorem mem_relatorSet_iff (P : GroupPresentation) (r : FreeGroup (Fin P.generatorCount)) :
    r ∈ P.relatorSet ↔ ∃ t ∈ P.transcribed, t.toFreeGroup = r := by
  simp [relatorSet]

/-- The relations of a presentation are the relator set of its transcribed expressions.

This is the bridge between the presentation-level relation set and `TauCeti.Relator.relatorSet`,
the notion in which the relator lists of a transcription are built and reasoned about, so a
consumer relating the two never has to re-derive the identification by extensionality.

It is deliberately not `@[simp]`: `mem_relatorSet_iff` above is the simp normal form of a
membership in `relatorSet`, and rewriting the set itself would take that lemma's left-hand side out
of normal form, which the `simpNF` linter rejects. -/
