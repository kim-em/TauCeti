# Auditable relator expressions

Finite group presentations in print use expressions such as powers and commutators, while
`FreeGroup` consumes flat words. This file provides a small expression language for transcribing
those published relators and compiles it to Mathlib's canonical signed-word representation
`List (α × Bool)`. In that representation `true` denotes a generator and `false` its inverse.

The central result, `TauCeti.Relator.toWord_toFreeGroup`, proves that compilation agrees with direct
structural interpretation in the free group. This makes the compiler a checked link between a
human-readable transcription and the relator used to define a presented group.

The representation and its interpretation reuse `FreeGroup.mk`, `FreeGroup.invRev`,
`commutatorElement`, and their compatibility with multiplication, inversion, and natural powers
from Mathlib.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.PresentationWord`: Mathlib's left-to-right list of signed generators.
* `TauCeti.Relator`: expressions built from generators, inverse, product, power, and commutator.
* `TauCeti.Relator.map`: renaming generators while preserving the expression structure.
* `TauCeti.Relator.toWord`: compilation of an expression to a signed word.
* `TauCeti.Relator.length`: the length of that word, computed from the expression without
  expanding powers.
* `TauCeti.Relator.eval`: structural evaluation under a generator assignment in any group.
* `TauCeti.Relator.toFreeGroup`: evaluation at the canonical free-group generators.
* `TauCeti.Relator.conj` and `TauCeti.Relator.div`: the conjugate `s⁻¹ r s` and the relator `r s⁻¹`
  by which a source states an equation between two words.
* `TauCeti.Relator.commInvInv`: the commutator `r⁻¹ s⁻¹ r s` of the presentation literature.
* `TauCeti.Relator.relatorSet`: the free-group elements denoted by a list of expressions.

## Main result

* `TauCeti.Relator.toWord_toFreeGroup`: compilation preserves the free-group element denoted by an
  expression.
* `TauCeti.Relator.relatorSet_eq_of_mem_map_toWord_iff`: relator lists with the same compiled-word
  membership denote the same relations.

## References

This file supplies the "relator expression type compiling to signed words" target of milestone S0
of `TauCetiRoadmap/CFSGStatement/README.md`. The design is not original here: the expression
language, its five constructors, the names `PresentationWord`, `Relator.toWord`,
`Relator.toFreeGroup`, and the statement of `Relator.toWord_toFreeGroup` are adapted from the
human-owned roadmap formalization in the accompanying `TauCetiRoadmap/CFSGStatement/Suggested.lean`,
where they are pinned as target signatures (with `sorry`ed proofs) by the roadmap's authors. The
adaptation replaces that file's bespoke `GeneratorLetter`/`PresentationWord.toFreeGroup` pair by
Mathlib's `List (α × Bool)` words and `FreeGroup.mk`, generalizes the generator type from `Fin n` to
an arbitrary `α`, and discharges the compilation theorem.

/-- The number of signed letters in the compiled word of a relator expression, read off the

A transcribed presentation checks its published letter count against
`TauCeti.GroupPresentation.totalLength`. Computing that count through `Relator.toWord` alone forces
every power to be expanded, which for a relator such as `(adefcefgh)³⁹` is hundreds of signed-letter
constructors; this function multiplies instead of repeating, and `TauCeti.Relator.length_toWord`
certifies that the two agree.

/-- The conjugate `s⁻¹ * r * s`, written `r ^ s` by most of the presentation literature.

Published presentations of the larger sporadic groups state many of their relators as conjugates,
so this is the shape a transcription of such a source needs. It is a derived form rather than a
sixth constructor: `Relator.toWord` and `Relator.toFreeGroup` therefore stay total on the five
constructors, and `Relator.toWord_toFreeGroup` covers it with no extra case.
