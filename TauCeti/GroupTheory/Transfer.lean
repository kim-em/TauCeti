# Transitivity of the transfer homomorphism

Let `H` be a subgroup of finite index of a group `G` and let `ϕ : H →* A` be a homomorphism to a
commutative group. This file complements Mathlib's `MonoidHom.transfer` with the three structural
properties of the transfer `V_ϕ : G →* A`:

* it can be computed from any family of coset representatives indexed by a finite type, with any
  compatible labelling of the permutation action of `g`:
  `V_ϕ(g) = ∏ᵢ ϕ(t_{π i}⁻¹ g tᵢ)` whenever `g tᵢ H = t_{π i} H`;
* it is natural in the commutative target and invariant under isomorphisms of the ambient group;
* it is **transitive**: for subgroups `K ≤ H ≤ G` with `K` of finite index, the transfer from `G`
  to `K` is the transfer from `G` to `H` followed by the transfer from `H` to `K`.

Finite indices that follow from the other hypotheses are not assumed: in the first property the
index of `H` is finite because the family is finite, an isomorphism carries a subgroup of finite
index to one of finite index, and in a tower `K ≤ H` the index of `H` divides that of `K`.

## Main results

* `MonoidHom.transfer_eq_prod_of_bijective`: the transfer computed from an arbitrary indexed
  family of coset representatives.
* `MonoidHom.transfer_eq_prod_mul_out`: for a normal subgroup, computation by right
  multiplication of quotient representatives, matching the factor-set convention.
* `MonoidHom.transfer_comp`: the transfer is natural in the commutative target.
* `MonoidHom.transfer_apply_of_mulEquiv`: the transfer is invariant under an isomorphism of
  ambient groups carrying one subgroup onto the other.
* `MonoidHom.transfer_transfer`: transitivity of the transfer along a tower `K ≤ H ≤ G`.
* `TauCeti.transfer_eq_prod_lWord`: computation with the transversal words used by
  cohomological corestriction.

/-- The transfer computed from coset representatives indexed by a finite type: if `i ↦ f i H` is a
bijection onto `G ⧸ H` and `π` labels the action of `g`, in the sense that `g (f i) H = f (π i) H`,
then `transfer ϕ g = ∏ᵢ ϕ ((f (π i))⁻¹ g (f i))`. Unlike `transfer_def`, which is phrased with
a `LeftTransversal` indexed by `G ⧸ H` itself, the index type `ι` here is arbitrary; such a `π` is
automatically a permutation of `ι`. The index of `H` is finite because `ι` is. -/
