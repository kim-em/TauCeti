# Consequences of the index formula

The preimage `H.comap f` of a finite-index subgroup along a group homomorphism again has finite
index: its index is the relative index of `H` in the range of `f`, which is finite. Adjoining
the centre to a finite-index subgroup also keeps the index finite, since it only enlarges the
subgroup.

Because the order of a subgroup divides the order of the group -- with the index as cofactor --
invertibility of the order of a finite group in a semiring passes to every subgroup.

Adjoining a two-element subgroup `N ⊄ Γ` normalised by `Γ` is also quantified: `Γ` then has
relative index exactly `2` in `Γ ⊔ N`, so `Γ.index = 2 * (Γ ⊔ N).index`. Taking `N` to be the
centre gives the `Γ.withCenter` readings.

## Main results

* `Subgroup.mem_withCenter_iff`: an element of `Γ·Z(G)` is one of `Γ` times a central one.
* `TauCeti.index_eq_of_natCard_eq_mul`: cancel a known nonzero subgroup order from the
  order-index formula.
* `Subgroup.withCenter_le_iff`: the universal property — containing `Γ·Z(G)` is containing both.
* `Subgroup.withCenter_eq_self_iff`: adjoining the centre changes nothing exactly when the
  centre already lies inside `Γ`.
* `Subgroup.relIndex_sup_eq_two`, `Subgroup.index_eq_two_mul_index_sup`: the relative index `2`
  and the index doubling, for an `N` normalised by `Γ` whose elements are `1` and `a ∉ Γ`.
* `Subgroup.relIndex_withCenter_eq_two`, `Subgroup.index_eq_two_mul_index_withCenter`: the same
  two facts on `Γ.withCenter`, when the centre is `{1, a}`.

/-- **A two-element subgroup normalised by `Γ` and not already inside it has relative index
`2`.** If every element of `N` is `1` or `a`, and `a ∉ Γ`, then `Γ ⊔ N` splits into the two
cosets `Γ` and `Γ * a`.

Only normalisation by `Γ` is asked for, not normality of `N` in the whole group, so a
two-element subgroup normalised by `Γ` alone is covered. A globally normal `N` is the special
case `Subgroup.le_normalizer_of_normal`.

Stated for an arbitrary `N` rather than for the centre, because the centre is often larger than
two elements — in `GL (Fin 2) ℝ` it is every scalar — while the two-element subgroup one actually
wants there is `Subgroup.zpowers (-1)`. A caller supplies whichever `N` is in hand.

`a` is not assumed to be an involution; it follows from the hypotheses that it is one.

which the two subgroups genuinely differ; they coincide exactly when the centre already lies
inside `Γ`.

For `Γ ≤ SL(2, ℤ)` the centre is `{±I}` and `a = -I`, so this is the quantitative form of the
dichotomy recorded on `Subgroup.withCenter`: cosets of `Γ` count each translate of `𝒟` twice
unless `-I ∈ Γ` already. -/
