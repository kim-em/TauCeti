# The root-datum special isogeny selected by a Suzuki--Ree index

The Steinberg endomorphism of a Suzuki or Ree group is an odd power of the exceptional isogeny of
its pinned ambient group. That isogeny exists only for `B₂` and `F₄` in characteristic two and for
`G₂` in characteristic three, and this file selects it, on root data, for every
`TauCeti.SuzukiReeIndex`: the Suzuki family takes the special isogeny of the pinned `B₂` datum, the
Ree `G₂` family that of `G₂`, and the Ree `F₄` family together with the Tits index that of `F₄`.

The point of selecting it here rather than downstream is that the selection carries a convention,
and the convention has to be checked against the one the CFSG roadmap fixes. Its exponent
assignment attaches `1` to a long simple root and the defining characteristic to a short one,
which is a genuine choice: the opposite assignment also squares to the prime-field Frobenius. The
upstream isogenies are pinned instead by squared root lengths, and
`TauCeti.SuzukiReeIndex.datumSpecialIsogeny_exponent_simpleIndex` and
`TauCeti.SuzukiReeIndex.datumSpecialIsogeny_weightMap_root_simpleIndex` are the statements that
the two agree. In the form the second one takes,

```text
τ (root (σ i)) = exponent i • root i,
```

the character map is the pullback along the group-scheme isogeny, so the exponent is indexed by
the node `i` whose root subgroup is being raised to a power and not by its image `σ i`; this is
the root-datum shadow of `τ (x_{α_i}(t)) = x_{α_{σ i}}(t ^ exponent i)`.

The permutation of nodes is checked in the same way.
`TauCeti.SuzukiReeIndex.isSpecialNodePerm_lengthPerm` reads the length permutation the index
carries as a `TauCeti.DynkinType.IsSpecialNodePerm`, which is the uniform root-level notion, and
`TauCeti.SuzukiReeIndex.datumSpecialIsogeny_indexEquiv_simpleIndex` says the upstream isogeny
permutes the simple-root indices by exactly that permutation. Since a special node permutation is
unique when it exists (`TauCeti.DynkinType.IsSpecialNodePerm.unique`), no second convention can
sneak in.

Nothing here is a group. The lift of these three isogenies from root data to the pinned
Chevalley--Demazure group schemes, and hence the finite groups themselves, are separate work.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.SuzukiReeIndex.datumSpecialIsogeny`: the special isogeny of the pinned simply connected
  root datum of the underlying untwisted Dynkin type of a Suzuki--Ree index.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.SuzukiReeIndex.datumSpecialIsogeny_weightMap_suzuki` and its fifteen siblings: the
  branch equations naming the selected isogeny on each of the four half-Frobenius families.
* `TauCeti.SuzukiReeIndex.isSpecialNodePerm_lengthPerm`: the pinned length permutation of an index
  is the special node permutation of its Dynkin type.
* `TauCeti.SuzukiReeIndex.rootLength_eq_characteristic_of_isLongSimpleRoot` and
  `TauCeti.SuzukiReeIndex.rootLength_eq_one_of_not_isLongSimpleRoot`: the two squared root lengths
  of such an index are its defining characteristic and one.
* `TauCeti.SuzukiReeIndex.rootLength_lengthPerm`: the squared length of the length-exchanged node
  is the roadmap's exponent, so the two conventions are the same one.
* `TauCeti.SuzukiReeIndex.datumSpecialIsogeny_indexEquiv_simpleIndex` and
  `TauCeti.SuzukiReeIndex.datumSpecialIsogeny_exponent_simpleIndex`: the selected isogeny permutes
  the simple-root indices by the pinned length permutation, with the pinned exponents.
* `TauCeti.SuzukiReeIndex.datumSpecialIsogeny_weightMap_root_simpleIndex` and
  `TauCeti.SuzukiReeIndex.datumSpecialIsogeny_coweightMap_coroot_simpleIndex`: the defining
  relation of the exceptional isogeny on the simple roots and on the simple coroots, in the
  exponent convention of the CFSG roadmap.
* `TauCeti.SuzukiReeIndex.datumSpecialIsogeny_comp_self`: its square is scaling by the defining
  characteristic, which is the root-datum form of `τ ^ 2 = Frob_p`.

## Roadmap and references

This is the selection half of milestone L2 of `TauCetiRoadmap/CFSGStatement/README.md`, which owns
"selecting `τ_X` for a given `SuzukiReeIndex`, checking that the upstream isogeny is the one this
roadmap's conventions describe, and taking the odd power" and states its exponent convention
against `TauCeti.DynkinType.IsLongSimpleRoot`. The isogeny selected here is the root-datum
half of the target "Special isogenies in characteristics two and three" of Layer 9 of
`TauCetiRoadmap/ReductiveGroups/README.md`, which owns the isogeny itself. This file is to L2 what
`TauCeti/GroupTheory/SpecificGroups/CFSG/RootDatumAutomorphism.lean` is to L1.

/-! ## Transport along an equality of root pairings

The special isogenies are constructed on the pinned data of the family modules, while a
Suzuki--Ree index names its datum through `TauCeti.DynkinType.simplyConnectedRootDatum`. The two
are equal, by the branch equations of that dispatcher, but not syntactically so; the transport
below reads one as the other. None of the four pieces of data of an isogeny has a type mentioning
the root pairing, so the transport moves only its three proof obligations and leaves the data
alone. -/

The four pieces of data of an isogeny are recorded one family at a time. Together they determine
the selected isogeny, since `TauCeti.RootPairingIsogeny` is extensional in exactly these four

/-- **The defining relation of the exceptional isogeny on the simple roots, in the exponent
convention of the CFSG roadmap.** The character map carries the simple root at the
length-exchanged node to the simple root at `i`, rescaled by `TauCeti.SuzukiReeIndex.exponent i`,
which is `1` at a long node and the defining characteristic at a short one.

The character map is the pullback along the group-scheme isogeny, so this is the root-datum shadow
of `τ (x_{α_i}(t)) = x_{α_{σ i}}(t ^ exponent i)`, with the exponent indexed by `i` rather than by
its image. -/
