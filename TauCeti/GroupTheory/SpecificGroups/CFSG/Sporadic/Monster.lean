# A transcribed presentation of the Monster group

This file records the `Y₄₄₃` presentation of the Monster as a `TauCeti.GroupPresentation`,
together with the exact diagram, source conventions, expected counts, and decidable transcription
checks.

The twelve involutory generators are the central node `a` and the nodes on three arms of lengths
four, four, and three:

```text
e₁ -- d₁ -- c₁ -- b₁ -- a -- b₂ -- c₂ -- d₂ -- e₂
                        |
                        b₃ -- c₃ -- d₃
```

The Coxeter relations contribute `12` square relations, `11` order-three edge relations, and `55`
order-two nonedge relations. The spider relation

```text
(a b₁ c₁ a b₂ c₂ a b₃ c₃)¹⁰ = 1
```

gives the `79`-relator presentation of `M × 2` displayed by Bray. Ivanov defines

```text
f₃₁₂ = (a b₃ c₃ d₃ b₁ c₁ b₂)⁹,
```

proves that it is central, and in Section 3.9 identifies the quotient `Y₄₄₃ / ⟨f₃₁₂⟩` with the
Monster. Appending `f₃₁₂ = 1` therefore gives the required `80`-relator presentation of `M`.

The source records length `400` for the `M × 2` presentation. The Coxeter words and spider word
below reproduce that figure; the final central relator has length `63`, giving total length `463`.

## Where each piece of the data comes from

Ivanov defines `Y_pqr` on p. 413, states the centrality of `f₃₁₂` in Lemma 3.2 on p. 419, and
identifies the quotient in Section 3.9 on pp. 430--431.

Ivanov's definition on p. 413 takes the Coxeter group on the central node `a` together with the
first `p`, `q`, and `r` of `b₁ c₁ d₁ e₁ f₁`, `b₂ c₂ d₂ e₂ f₂`, and `b₃ c₃ d₃ e₃ f₃`, with the
Coxeter relations of the induced subdiagram of `Y₅₅₅`, and quotients it by the spider relation
`(a b₁ c₁ a b₂ c₂ a b₃ c₃)¹⁰ = 1` displayed in the introduction on p. 412. At `(p,q,r) = (4,4,3)`
those generators are `a`, `b₁ c₁ d₁ e₁`, `b₂ c₂ d₂ e₂`, and `b₃ c₃ d₃`, which is the twelve-node
alphabet of `presentation.generatorNames`, and the induced subdiagram is the arm structure `edges`
records: eleven edges, four along each of the first two arms and three along the third, so the
simply laced `coxeterMatrix` built from them is the source's Coxeter data. `spiderRelator` is the
displayed spider word letter for letter.

The `M × 2` figures Bray records, twelve generators, seventy-nine relators, and length `400`, are
the ones the Coxeter data yields: twelve involutions of length two, eleven order-three edge
relations of length six, and fifty-five commuting non-edge relations of length four give
`24 + 66 + 220 = 310`, and the spider word of length ninety brings the total to `400`. Those
counts are `length_coxeterRelators` and `coxeterAndSpider_totalLength` below.

For the final relator, Ivanov's p. 419 defines, for `{i,j,k} = {1,2,3}`,
`f_ijk = (a bᵢ cᵢ dᵢ b_j c_j b_k)⁹`, the generator of the centre of the `Sp₆(2) × 2` Coxeter group
on the spherical `E₇` subdiagram `a, bᵢ, cᵢ, dᵢ, b_j, c_j, b_k`. Instantiating `(i,j,k) = (3,1,2)`
gives `(a b₃ c₃ d₃ b₁ c₁ b₂)⁹`, which is `centralInvolutionRelator` letter for letter, and its
seven-letter word repeated nine times is the length `63` checked below. Section 3.9 concludes on
p. 431 that `Y₄₄₃ / ⟨f₃₁₂⟩ ≅ M`, and hence that `Y₄₄₃ ≅ 2 × M`, so appending this one relator to
Bray's seventy-nine is exactly the passage from `M × 2` to `M`.

This file asserts no order, finiteness, or simplicity result for the presented group.
