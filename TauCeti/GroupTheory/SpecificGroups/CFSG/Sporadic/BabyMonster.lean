# A transcribed presentation of the Baby Monster

This file records the `Y₄₃₃` presentation of the Baby Monster as a `TauCeti.GroupPresentation`,
together with the diagram it expands, the exact source, the generator convention, the
transcription notes, and decidable checks on the transcribed data.

The eleven involutory generators are the nodes of a `Y`-shaped Coxeter diagram: a chain of eight
nodes with a further arm of three nodes attached to its fifth node,

```text
t₁ -- t₂ -- t₃ -- t₄ -- t₅ -- t₆ -- t₇ -- t₈
                        |
                        t₉ -- t₁₀ -- t₁₁
```

so that the branch node `t₅` carries three arms, of lengths four, three and three; this is what the
name `Y₄₃₃` records. The Coxeter relations contribute `11` square relators and one relator
`(tᵢ tⱼ) ^ m` for each of the `55` unordered pairs of distinct nodes, with `m = 3` on the ten edges
and `m = 2` off them. Adjoining the spider relation

```text
(t₅ t₄ t₃ t₅ t₆ t₇ t₅ t₉ t₁₀) ^ 10 = 1
```

presents `2 × 2·B`, and adjoining the two further relations

```text
(t₅ t₄ t₃ t₆ t₇ t₈ t₉) ^ 9 = 1,      (t₅ t₄ t₃ t₆ t₉ t₁₀ t₁₁) ^ 9 = 1
```

presents the Baby Monster itself. The `69` relators are therefore `66 + 1 + 2`.

The source presents the abstract group rather than recognizing generators inside a group
constructed elsewhere. The presentation was conjectured in the ATLAS of Finite Groups and proved by
Ivanov, subject to the Monster having no proper double cover; that hypothesis is Griess's
determination of the Schur multiplier of the Monster. The row below records that chain of
attributions rather than reproving any part of it.

Nothing here asserts that the presented group is nontrivial, finite or simple, that it has any
particular order, or that it is isomorphic to any other construction of the Baby Monster.

## Source-to-Lean read-through

The transcription was compared with Breuer--Magaard--Wilson, Section 3.1, in arXiv:1902.07758v2.
The source numbers eleven involutions `t₁` through `t₁₁` and lists the exponent-three pairs

```text
(1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5), (5,6), (6,7), (7,8), (5,9), (9,10), (10,11).
```

After the source's one-based numbering is shifted to `Fin 11`, these are exactly the ten
undirected pairs in `edges_eq`. The source assigns exponent two to every other pair `i < j`, which
is exactly the complement selected by `coxeterMatrix_apply`; the diagonal entries supply the
eleven square relations. Thus the Coxeter list contains the source's `11 + 10 + 45 = 66`
relations, with none dropped or duplicated.

The source next displays the spider word

```text
(t₅ t₄ t₃ t₅ t₆ t₇ t₅ t₉ t₁₀)^10
```

and the two words

```text
(t₅ t₄ t₃ t₆ t₇ t₈ t₉)^9,  (t₅ t₄ t₃ t₆ t₉ t₁₀ t₁₁)^9.
```

Their letters, order, and exponents agree exactly with `spiderRelator_def`,
`extraRelatorOne_def`, and `extraRelatorTwo_def`. The source states that the Coxeter relations plus
the spider relation present `2 × 2·B`, and that adjoining the last two relations presents `B`.
`adjoinedRelators_def` lists precisely those three words in that order, and `relatorList_def`
appends them to the Coxeter relators, giving the checked total `66 + 3 = 69`.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.Sporadic.BabyMonster.arms` and `TauCeti.Sporadic.BabyMonster.edges`: the three arms of
  the `Y₄₃₃` diagram and the edges they contribute.
* `TauCeti.Sporadic.BabyMonster.coxeterMatrix`: the Coxeter matrix of the numbered diagram.
* `TauCeti.Sporadic.BabyMonster.spiderRelator`: the spider relation of the source.
* `TauCeti.Sporadic.BabyMonster.extraRelatorOne` and
  `TauCeti.Sporadic.BabyMonster.extraRelatorTwo`: the two further relations the source adjoins to
  pass from `2 × 2·B` to `B`.
* `TauCeti.Sporadic.BabyMonster.presentation`: the transcribed row.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Sporadic.BabyMonster.map_length_neighbors`: the degree sequence of the transcribed
  diagram, a check consistent with the published `Y`-shape; `edges_eq` and `map_length_arms` pin
  the shape itself.
* `TauCeti.Sporadic.BabyMonster.length_relatorList` and
  `TauCeti.Sporadic.BabyMonster.matchesMetadata_presentation`: the transcription count checks.
* `TauCeti.Sporadic.BabyMonster.presentation_totalLength`: the compiled relator words contain `478`
  letters, of which `262` come from the Coxeter relators, by
  `TauCeti.Sporadic.BabyMonster.sum_map_length_coxeterRelators`, and the rest from the three
  adjoined relators. The source records no presentation length, so this is transcribed data stated
  for comparison with the source rather than a check against a published figure.
* `TauCeti.Sporadic.BabyMonster.presentation_relatorsCyclicallyReduced`: every compiled word is
  cyclically reduced, which is what makes that letter count comparable with a published
  presentation length at all.
* `TauCeti.Sporadic.BabyMonster.mulEquivPresentedGroupCoxeterAppend`: the row presents the Coxeter
  group of the diagram cut down by the three adjoined relations, which is the shape of the source's
  statement.

/-! ### The numbered `Y₄₃₃` diagram

`TauCeti.Sporadic.BabyMonster.nodup_branchNode_cons_flatten_arms` each generator of the
presentation occupies exactly one position of the diagram. -/

/-- The edges of the diagram: each arm contributes the edge joining it to the branch node and an
edge between each pair of nodes consecutive along it. Pairs are oriented outwards; the Coxeter
matrix below reads them symmetrically. -/
def edges : List (Fin 11 × Fin 11) := arms.flatMap fun arm => (branchNode :: arm).zip arm

/-- The ten edges of the numbered diagram, written out.

Read with the offset `tᵢ ↦ i - 1`, these are the source's ten adjacent pairs
`(1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5), (5,6), (6,7), (7,8), (5,9), (9,10), (10,11)`. The first arm's four

neighbors; the three arm ends `t₁`, `t₈` and `t₁₁`, that is indices `0`, `7` and `10`, have one

has a degree sequence consistent with the `Y`-shape. The shape itself is pinned by `edges_eq`
together with `map_length_arms` and `nodup_branchNode_cons_flatten_arms`, from which the edges are
built. -/
