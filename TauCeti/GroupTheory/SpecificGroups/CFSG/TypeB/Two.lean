# The two families on the rank-two diagram `B₂`

Two classification-list families are built on the rank-two diagram `B₂`: the untwisted `B₂(q)` and
the Suzuki family `²B₂(2^(2m+1))`. They share a diagram, so they share a carrier, and
`TauCeti.RankTwoBLieIndex` is the subtype that collects exactly them. This file supplies, for every
such index, the group of algebraic-closure-valued points of Tau Ceti's explicit full-weight type-`C`
Chevalley carrier at its rank-two member, `TauCeti.SpStd.groupScheme 1`, together with that group's
Bourbaki-numbered simple root subgroups, its `q`-power Frobenius, and the description of the points
that Frobenius fixes.

The rank-two type-`C` carrier is not a substitution for the diagram the families name: the two
constructor names `B 2` and `C 2` denote the same rank-two root system, which is why
`TauCeti.DynkinType.Valid` keeps only `B 2` of the two, and the identification is recorded rather
than assumed. What is recorded is an identification of numbered root characters, not of group
schemes. `TauCeti.SpStd.rootGeneratorWeight_inl_eq_root_simpleIndex_B_two` shows that
the character by which the carrier's split torus rescales the parameter of its `k`-th numbered
raising subgroup is the simple root of the `B₂` root datum at the *other* node. So the node
correspondence `TauCeti.RankTwoBLieIndex.carrierNode` composes the rank equality with the swap of
the two nodes, and every numbered object below is indexed by `Fin d.1.rank`, the upstream Bourbaki
index type of the index's own Dynkin type, rather than by a node of the carrier.

## What the shared Frobenius is for on each branch

The two families differ exactly in the endomorphism whose fixed points are taken. On the untwisted
branch that endomorphism is the `q`-power Frobenius outright, in keeping with the trivial diagram
permutation that `TauCeti.TypeBLieIndex.diagramPerm_eq_one` computes after the canonical inclusion
into the general type-`B` family: the `B₂` diagram has no symmetry to twist by, its two nodes
carrying different root lengths. On the Suzuki
branch it is instead `τ ^ (2m+1)` for the special isogeny `τ` of the pinned `B₂` group scheme in
characteristic two, which is not constructed here. That `τ` satisfies `τ ^ 2 = Frob_p` in the
prime characteristic. Both Frobenius maps are supplied below:
`TauCeti.RankTwoBLieIndex.frobenius` is the `q`-power one, the map the odd power `τ ^ (2m+1)`
squares to, and `TauCeti.RankTwoBLieIndex.primeFrobenius` is the `p`-power one that `τ` itself
squares to. On a Suzuki index they differ, validity forcing `1 ≤ m` and so `q = 2 ^ (2m+1)` above
the prime; on an untwisted index of prime field order they coincide.
A Suzuki index reaches all of it through `TauCeti.SuzukiLieIndex.toRankTwoBLieIndex`.

Neither branch gets a Steinberg endomorphism here. What is named below is named after what it is:
`TauCeti.RankTwoBLieIndex.frobenius` is the Frobenius of this carrier, and
`TauCeti.RankTwoBLieIndex.mem_fixedSubgroup_frobenius_iff` describes the group it fixes as the
points whose matrix entries lie in the field of definition `𝔽_q`. The Steinberg and fixed-group
APIs require a pinned carrier, which this file does not supply.

The Suzuki branch's Steinberg endomorphism is stated on this carrier in
`TauCeti/GroupTheory/SpecificGroups/CFSG/Suzuki/Basic.lean`. No identification of this carrier with
the pinned simply connected group scheme of the diagram is available, so neither file offers it as
a substitute for that pinned group: that construction carries over to the pinned group once such an
identification is proved, and not before.

Nothing here asserts that the carrier is reductive, that its weight torus is maximal, that it is
the symplectic group scheme, or that any group below is finite, perfect, or simple. In particular
the carrier is not claimed to be *the* simply connected Chevalley--Demazure group scheme of type
`B₂`: no pinning datum is constructed for it here or in the files it imports, which say so
themselves. The identification with the `B₂` diagram proved below is the one on numbered root
characters stated in `rootGeneratorWeight_carrierNode_eq_root_simpleIndex`.

The same carrier-and-Frobenius material on the branches already assembled is in
`TauCeti/GroupTheory/SpecificGroups/CFSG/TypeA.lean`,
`TauCeti/GroupTheory/SpecificGroups/CFSG/TypeE6.lean` and
`TauCeti/GroupTheory/SpecificGroups/CFSG/Unimodular.lean`.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.RankTwoBLieIndex.carrierNode`: the node correspondence `Fin d.1.rank ≃ Fin 2` between the
  Bourbaki numbering of `B₂` and the numbering of the rank-two type-`C` carrier.
* `TauCeti.RankTwoBLieIndex.AmbientGroup`: the algebraic-closure-valued points of that carrier.
* `TauCeti.RankTwoBLieIndex.simpleRootSubgroup`: the positive simple-root subgroup at a Bourbaki
  node.
* `TauCeti.RankTwoBLieIndex.rootGeneratorWeight_carrierNode_eq_root_simpleIndex`: the character of
  that subgroup is the corresponding simple root of the `B₂` root datum.
* `TauCeti.RankTwoBLieIndex.frobenius`, `TauCeti.RankTwoBLieIndex.coe_frobenius_apply` and
  `TauCeti.RankTwoBLieIndex.frobenius_simpleRootSubgroup`: the `q`-power Frobenius, its entrywise
  description, and its simple-root-subgroup action formula `Frob_q (x_i(u)) = x_i(u ^ q)`.
* `TauCeti.RankTwoBLieIndex.mem_fixedSubgroup_frobenius_iff`: its fixed points are the points whose
  matrix entries lie in the field of definition `𝔽_q`.
* `TauCeti.RankTwoBLieIndex.primeFrobenius`,
  `TauCeti.RankTwoBLieIndex.coe_primeFrobenius_apply` and
  `TauCeti.RankTwoBLieIndex.primeFrobenius_simpleRootSubgroup`: the prime-field Frobenius, its
  entrywise description, and its simple-root-subgroup action formula
  `Frob_p (x_i(u)) = x_i(u ^ p)`, the map an odd power of a half-Frobenius on this diagram is built
  over.

/-! ## The node correspondence -/

/-- **The rank-two type-`C` carrier node corresponding to a Bourbaki-numbered node of `B₂`**, with
the inverse equivalence giving the correspondence back. It is the rank equality
`TauCeti.RankTwoBLieIndex.rank_eq_two` followed by the swap of the two nodes, the swap being what
`TauCeti.SpStd.rootGeneratorWeight_inl_eq_root_simpleIndex_B_two` shows the two numberings differ
by. -/

/-! ## The ambient group and its simple root subgroups -/

/-- **The ambient group this file attaches to a validated index on the `B₂` diagram**: the points of
the explicit full-weight rank-two type-`C` Chevalley carrier over the algebraic closure of its prime
field. It is infinite; no finiteness, reductivity, pinning or maximality statement is attached to
it, and it is not claimed to be the points of the pinned simply connected group scheme of type
`B₂`; no such identification is available, as the module docstring explains.

It is the same group for the untwisted and the Suzuki family of a given field order, those two
differing only in the endomorphism taken of it. -/
abbrev AmbientGroup : Type := SpStd.points 1 d.1.Closure

/-- The positive simple-root subgroup at the Bourbaki-numbered node `i` of the `B₂` diagram. It is
the carrier's numbered raising subgroup at the node that `carrierNode` names. -/
def simpleRootSubgroup (i : Fin d.1.rank) : Multiplicative d.1.Closure →* d.AmbientGroup :=
  SpStd.rootSubgroupPoints 1 (.inl (d.carrierNode i)) d.1.Closure

/-- The simple-root subgroup is the carrier's numbered raising subgroup at the corresponding
carrier node. This is the equation through which the upstream root-subgroup API reaches
`simpleRootSubgroup`. It is not a `simp` lemma: `frobenius_simpleRootSubgroup` is the normal form
the simple-root-subgroup action equations of this file are stated against, and unfolding to
`TauCeti.SpStd.rootSubgroupPoints` would keep it from firing. -/
theorem simpleRootSubgroup_def (i : Fin d.1.rank) :
    d.simpleRootSubgroup i = SpStd.rootSubgroupPoints 1 (.inl (d.carrierNode i)) d.1.Closure :=

/-- **The simple-root subgroups sit at the simple roots of the `B₂` root datum.** The character
by which the carrier's split torus rescales the parameter of `simpleRootSubgroup i`, read in the
same node correspondence, is the `i`-th simple root of
`TauCeti.DynkinType.simplyConnectedRootDatum` at `B 2`. This is the sense in which the rank-two
type-`C` carrier serves the diagram that the two rank-two type-`B` families name; it is not a claim
that the carrier is the pinned group of that diagram, no pinning being constructed for it. -/

/-! ## The Frobenius endomorphism -/

/-- **The `q`-power Frobenius endomorphism of the ambient group of an index on the `B₂` diagram**,
for `q` the field order the index records. The map the Steinberg endomorphism of either family on
this diagram is built from is its counterpart on the pinned simply connected carrier: on the
untwisted family `B₂(q)` that endomorphism is the `q`-power Frobenius outright, and on the Suzuki
family it is the odd power `τ ^ (2m+1)` of the special isogeny, the map that odd power squares to
being the `q`-power Frobenius. Neither is formed here. -/
def frobenius : d.AmbientGroup →* d.AmbientGroup :=

/-- The Frobenius of an index on the `B₂` diagram is the carrier's Frobenius at the exponent the
index records. This is its unfolding lemma; the definition itself stays sealed.

It is deliberately not a `simp` lemma: `frobenius_simpleRootSubgroup` and `coe_frobenius_apply` are
the normal forms the simple-root-subgroup action equations of this file are stated against, and
unfolding to
`TauCeti.SpStd.frobenius` would keep them from firing. -/

/-- The Frobenius acts on the ambient group by raising every matrix entry to the `q`-th power.

The index type is written `Fin 4`, which is the carrier's own `Fin ((1 + 1) + (1 + 1))` at `n = 1`
definitionally but not syntactically. Only the binders of `r` and `c` are affected: the entry
coercions elaborate at the carrier's index type either way. -/

Frobenius factor of a Steinberg map on the numbered simple-root subgroups. -/

/-- **The prime-field Frobenius endomorphism of the ambient group of an index on the `B₂`
diagram**, the `p`-power map for `p` the defining characteristic. It agrees with the `q`-power map
`TauCeti.RankTwoBLieIndex.frobenius` above exactly when the index has field order `p`, which
happens on an untwisted branch of prime field order and never on a Suzuki index, whose validity
forces `q = 2 ^ (2m+1)` with `1 ≤ m`. It is the map that the half-Frobenius of a Suzuki index
squares to. -/

/-- **A point of the ambient group is fixed by the Frobenius exactly when all of its matrix entries
lie in the field of definition.** Writing `𝔽_q` for `TauCeti.ValidLieTypeIndex.fixedField`, the copy
of the field of `q` elements inside the algebraic closure, the Frobenius fixed points are the points
of the rank-two type-`C` carrier whose entries lie in `𝔽_q`. As in `coe_frobenius_apply`, the index
type is written `Fin 4` for the carrier's own `Fin ((1 + 1) + (1 + 1))` at `n = 1`; here the two
entry binders are elaborated at the carrier's index type as well.

As for `TauCeti.ValidLieTypeIndex.mem_fixedSubgroup_geckFrobenius_iff`, this is not a `simp` lemma:
`TauCeti.fixedSubgroup` is `MonoidHom.eqLocus` against the identity, so `simp` rewrites its
left-hand side to `d.frobenius g = g` through `MonoidHom.mem_eqLocus`, and the `simpNF` linter
rejects the annotation. -/
