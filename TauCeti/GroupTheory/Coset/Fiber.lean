# A nonempty fiber of a group homomorphism is a copy of the kernel

A nonempty fiber of `f` is a coset of `ker f`. Mathlib's `AddMonoidHom.fiberEquivKer` says this in
the set-preimage form `f ⁻¹' {f a}`, with the attained value written as a value of `f`, and over an
additive *group*. A caller usually meets the fiber as the subtype `{a // f a = b}` instead and
holds `f a = b` separately, and a kernel asks only `AddZeroClass` of the codomain, so
`subtypeFiberEquivKer` is built here at that generality: `x ↦ -a + x`, with `a + ·` back. Four
consequences follow from it: the fiber is counted, made finite, and a sum over it is reindexed as a
sum over the kernel; and summing `g ∘ f` along a surjective `f` counts each value of `g` as often
as the kernel has elements.

Finiteness is the one of the four that needs no preimage: an empty fiber is finite as well, so the
statement is available before any point of the fiber is known, which is what a caller quantifying
over all values of `f` wants.

The multiplication map `n • ·` of an additive commutative group is the case the counting arguments
for isogenies use: each of its nonempty fibers has as many elements as the `n`-torsion. Emptiness
is not excluded by fiat — `n • ·` need not be surjective. The cardinality and reindexing results
therefore take a point in the fiber as an argument, while the finiteness result does not.

## Main results

* `AddMonoidHom.subtypeFiberEquivKer` (and `MonoidHom.subtypeFiberEquivKer`): the fiber over an
  attained value, as a subtype, is equivalent to the kernel, translating by `-a` and its inverse
  by `a`.
* `AddMonoidHom.card_fiber_eq_card_ker` (and `MonoidHom.card_fiber_eq_card_ker`): a nonempty
  fiber has as many elements as the kernel.
* `AddMonoidHom.finite_fiber` (and `MonoidHom.finite_fiber`): every fiber is finite when the
  kernel is.
* `AddMonoidHom.sum_fiber_eq_sum_ker_add_left` (and
  `MonoidHom.prod_fiber_eq_prod_ker_mul_left`): summing an arbitrary function over a nonempty fiber
  is summing its values on `a + t` over the kernel.
* `AddMonoidHom.sum_comp_of_surjective` (and `MonoidHom.prod_comp_of_surjective`): summing
  `g ∘ f` along a surjective homomorphism counts each value of `g` as often as the kernel.
* `TauCeti.card_zsmul_fiber_eq_card_zsmul_eq_zero`: the same for `n • ·` on an additive commutative
  group, with the kernel written as the `n`-torsion.

## Provenance

Generalized from the AINTLIB `HasseWeil` project (`github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB`, Apache-2.0)
pinned at `a302aeacd86053f9d5f991fbbf664e1cc1051d08`: `HasseWeil/HasseBound/WeilPairing/Fiber.lean`,
declarations `fiberEquivKer`, `fiber_finite` and `fiber_card_eq_ker_card`, and
`HasseWeil/HasseBound/WeilPairing/SigmaBridge.lean`, declaration `fiber_sum_eq_ker_sum`. There they
are stated for an endomorphism of the point group of an elliptic curve; here they hold of any
homomorphism of groups, the commutative hypothesis appearing only where an unordered product is
taken. Like the source, the equivalence is built directly: Mathlib's `fiberEquivKer` requires a
group codomain, while this version only needs `MulOneClass` (additively, `AddZeroClass`). On the
overlap the two equivalences use the same translations.

/-- **A nonempty fiber is a copy of the kernel**, in the subtype form: given `ha : f a = b`, the
fiber over `b` is `a` times the kernel. Mathlib's `MonoidHom.fiberEquivKer` is the same map at
`[Group H]`, stated on the set preimage `f ⁻¹' {f a}`; the codomain of a kernel needs only
`MulOneClass`, which is where this is built. -/
