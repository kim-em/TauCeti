# Classes of finite groups

A **class of finite groups** in the sense of profinite group theory is a collection `C` of
finite groups that is closed under isomorphism, subgroups, quotients and extensions, and
contains the trivial group. Finite `p`-groups, finite solvable groups and all finite groups are
the examples of record. Such a class is exactly the data needed to speak of a pro-`C` group and
of the universal pro-`C` quotient of a topological group, so it is bundled here as a structure
rather than left as a loose predicate.

Closure under finite products is a *consequence* of the four closure properties, through the
extension `1 → H → H × K → K → 1`, and so is a theorem here rather than a field.

The membership predicate of a class carries the typeclass assumptions `[Group H] [Finite H]`,
which is awkward for a group that is not yet known to be finite. `FiniteGroupClass.MemFinite`
packages the two together: `C.MemFinite H` says that `H` is finite and belongs to `C`. All the
closure properties below are stated in that form, because the groups they are applied to —
quotients of a topological group by open normal subgroups — are finite for a reason that is
not visible in the statement.

The raw membership predicate speaks about groups in one universe. For a finite group in any
other universe, `FiniteGroupClass.MemFinite` transports its group structure through `Shrink`;
thus all derived constructions are universe-independent.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.FiniteGroupClass`: a class of finite groups, as the data of its membership
  predicate together with its closure properties.
* `TauCeti.FiniteGroupClass.MemFinite`: membership of a group that is not yet known to be
  finite.
* `TauCeti.finiteGroupClassP`: the class of finite `p`-groups.
* `TauCeti.finiteGroupClassTrivial`: the class of finite trivial groups.
* `TauCeti.finiteGroupClassSolvable`: the class of finite solvable groups.
* `TauCeti.finiteGroupClassAll`: the class of all finite groups.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.FiniteGroupClass.MemFinite.prod`: a class of finite groups is closed under binary
  products.
* `TauCeti.FiniteGroupClass.MemFinite.pi`: and under finite products.
* `TauCeti.FiniteGroupClass.MemFinite.quotient_inf`: the normal subgroups with quotient in the
  class are closed under binary intersection.
* `TauCeti.FiniteGroupClass.MemFinite.quotient_comap`: they are preserved by preimage along a
  group homomorphism.
