# The annular terms of the unblocked grid differential square vanish

The square of the unblocked grid differential `∂⁻` of `Unblocked.lean` is a sum over pairs of
composable rectangles. The juxtaposition argument for `∂⁻ ∘ ∂⁻ = 0` splits those pairs according
to how the two rectangles meet, and the *annular* case is the one in which the second rectangle
returns to the source of the first. This file closes that case.

The mechanism is that a returning pair covers a full toroidal annulus,
`GridRectangleBetween.coveredSquares_union_coveredSquares`, and a grid diagram has an
`X`-marking in every column and in every row. So a returning pair always covers an `X`-marking,
and the unblocked differential counts only rectangles that cover none: between two grid states,
at most one of the two directions contributes at all
(`GridDiagram.unblockedRectangles_eq_empty_or_unblockedRectangles_eq_empty`). The unblocked
differential therefore has no two-step return, and the diagonal entries of the matrix of
`∂⁻ ∘ ∂⁻` are zero.

The argument never inspects the `O`-markings, so it is insensitive to the weights `V^{O(r)}` and
runs over an arbitrary commutative coefficient ring, characteristic two included. The three cases
of the juxtaposition analysis are told apart by how many side columns the two rectangles have in
common: both for the annular case treated here, none for the disjoint case of
`Differential/Square/DoubleTransposition.lean`, and exactly one for the overlapping case.
On a grid of size at most two the annular case already suffices, because there is no room for the
other two: that consequence is
`GridDiagram.unblockedDifferential_comp_self_eq_zero_of_le_two` in `SmallGrid/Differential.lean`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.unblockedRectangles_eq_empty_or_unblockedRectangles_eq_empty`: between two
  grid states, one of the two directions carries no rectangle the unblocked differential counts.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.unblockedCoefficient_mul_unblockedCoefficient_eq_zero`: the product of the
  two matrix coefficients of `∂⁻` between a pair of grid states vanishes.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.unblockedDifferential_sq_single_apply_self`: its diagonal entries vanish.
