# Stabilization invariance of `GH⁻` for the north-east corner

Up to cyclic permutations and commutations, every grid stabilization is one of two corner types
(`GridDiagram.IsStabilization.exists_commutationMovesTo`): for a column `s` of `G`, either
`G.stabilizeX s.castSucc (G.X s).castSucc s`, whose new `O`-marking is the south-west corner of
the new block, or `G' = G.stabilizeX s.succ (G.X s).succ s`, whose new `O`-marking is the
north-east corner. The first is treated in `Stabilization/Homology.lean`. This file treats the
second by the half-turn of the torus, which exchanges the two corners
(`GridDiagram.rotate_stabilizeX_succ`): the half-turn of `G'` is the south-west stabilization of
`G.rotate` at the column `s.rev`.

Write `A = R[V₀, …, V_{n-1}]` and `S = R[V₀, …, V_n]`. Conjugating the south-west stabilization
chain map of `G.rotate` by the half-turns `GC⁻(G') → GC⁻(G'.rotate)` and
`GC⁻(G.rotate) → GC⁻(G)` gives a chain map `GC⁻(G') → GC⁻(G)`
(`GridDiagram.stabilizeXSuccChainMap`). The renamings of the variables along `Fin.rev` on both
sides cancel against the merging of variables along `s.rev.predAbove`, so the chain map is
semilinear along the renaming `S → A` along `s.predAbove`, which merges the two variables of the
columns `s.castSucc` and `s.succ` of the new block into `V_s`, exactly as for the south-west
corner. The induced map `GH⁻(G') → GH⁻(G)` (`GridDiagram.stabilizeXSuccHomologyMap`) is a
composite of two half-turn equivalences and the south-west stabilization map of `G.rotate`, so
it is bijective.

The half-turn preserves the Alexander grading and `τ` (`Homology/HalfTurn.lean`).
Consequently `τ` is also invariant under this north-east stabilization, by conjugating the
south-west stabilization with the two half-turns.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.stabilizeXSuccChainMap`: the chain map `GC⁻(G') → GC⁻(G)` of the
  north-east stabilization, as a semilinear map.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.stabilizeXSuccHomologyMap`: the induced semilinear map
  `GH⁻(G') → GH⁻(G)`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.stabilizeXSuccChainMap_unblockedDifferential`: `stabilizeXSuccChainMap`
  commutes with the unblocked differentials.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.stabilizeXSuccHomologyMap_unblockedHomologyClass`: the class of a cycle
  `z` goes to the class of `stabilizeXSuccChainMap z`.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.stabilizeXSuccHomologyMap_bijective`: **stabilization invariance of
  `GH⁻` for the north-east corner**, the map on homology is bijective.

## References

Stabilization invariance of grid homology is Ozsváth--Stipsicz--Szabó, *Grid Homology for Knots
and Links*, Section 5.2, where the stabilization types other than the one treated directly are
reduced to it by the symmetries of grid diagrams of Chapter 3.
