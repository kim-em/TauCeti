# The fully blocked grid homology

This file introduces the homology of the fully blocked grid complex as the subquotient of the
finite free grid chain module by cycles over boundaries, and evaluates it on the smallest grids.

The cycle submodule (`fullyBlockedCycles`, the kernel of the differential) and the boundary
submodule (`fullyBlockedBoundaries`, its range) were built in `BasicCycles.lean`. Viewing the
boundaries inside the cycles gives `fullyBlockedBoundariesInCycles`, and the homology is their
subquotient

`fullyBlockedHomology G = fullyBlockedCycles G ⧸ fullyBlockedBoundariesInCycles G`,

the cycles modulo the boundaries that are themselves cycles. Whenever the differential squares to
zero every boundary is a cycle (`fullyBlockedBoundaries_le_cycles`), so the subquotient is the
genuine homology `Z / B`; the general subquotient form is what lets us name the object before the
square-zero theorem is available in every grid size. Two cycles represent the same homology class
exactly when their difference is a boundary (`fullyBlockedHomology_mk_eq_iff`), independently of
square-zeroness.

For grids of size at most two the differential vanishes (`SmallGridDifferential.lean`), so every
chain is a cycle and the only boundary is zero. The homology is therefore the whole chain module:
it is `ZMod 2`-linearly isomorphic to `GridChain (ZMod 2) n`, has `2 ^ n!` elements, and has
`ZMod 2`-dimension `n!`. On the standard `2 × 2` unknot grid this is dimension two, the rank of
the stabilization factor `W = 𝔽 ⊕ 𝔽` predicted by `GH̃(G) ≅ GĤ(L) ⊗ W^{⊗(n-1)}` for the unknot.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.fullyBlockedBoundariesInCycles`: the boundaries viewed inside the cycles.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.fullyBlockedHomology`: the fully blocked grid homology, cycles modulo the
  boundaries lying in them.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.fullyBlockedHomologyEquivChainOfLeTwo`: for `n ≤ 2` the homology is
  isomorphic to the whole chain module.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.fullyBlockedHomology_mk_eq_iff`: two cycles are homologous exactly when
  their difference is a boundary.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.natCard_fullyBlockedHomology_of_le_two` and
  `TauCeti.GridDiagram.finrank_fullyBlockedHomology_of_le_two`: the small-grid cardinality
  `2 ^ n!` and dimension `n!`.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.natCard_fullyBlockedHomology_of_two` and
  `TauCeti.GridDiagram.finrank_fullyBlockedHomology_of_two`: the four-element, dimension-two
  homology of the `2 × 2` unknot grid, exhibiting the rank-two `W` factor.

"The complexes and `∂² = 0`", and the acceptance criterion that grid homology compute on the
`2 × 2` unknot grid with its bigradings, exhibiting the `W^{⊗(n-1)}` stabilization factor. The
homology and stabilization conventions follow Ozsváth--Stipsicz--Szabó, *Grid Homology for Knots
and Links*, Chapter 4.

This is the subquotient `Z ⧸ (B ⊓ Z)`, which is the genuine homology `Z / B` once every boundary
is a cycle, i.e. once the differential squares to zero (`fullyBlockedBoundaries_le_cycles`). Using
the subquotient lets the object be named uniformly, before the square-zero theorem is available in
every grid size. -/
