# Pairing grid points against markings at the centers of their squares

The `J`-function of `JFunction/Basic.lean` compares two sets of grid points with the strict
southwest relation. The Maslov and Alexander gradings, however, pair a *grid state*, which
occupies grid points, against the `O`- and `X`-*markings*, which sit at the **centers** of
squares. In the planar realization of a grid, the marking of the square named by the grid point
`q` sits at `q + (1/2, 1/2)`: half a unit northeast of `q`, and never on a grid line. So a grid
point `p` lies southwest of that marking exactly when `p ≤ q` in both coordinates, whereas the
marking lies southwest of `p` exactly when `q < p` in both coordinates. Only the first of the two
comparisons changes: this file records the weakened one and builds the state-against-markings
pairing out of it.

Writing `𝒥` for the resulting pairing, the gradings are
`M_O(x) = J(x, x) - 2 𝒥(x, 𝕆) + J(𝕆, 𝕆) + 1` and likewise for `M_X`, following
Ozsváth--Stipsicz--Szabó. Note that `𝒥` is genuinely asymmetric in its two arguments: the left
argument holds grid points and the right argument names squares, so there is no analogue of
`GridPoint.J_comm`. Marking-against-marking and state-against-state pairings need no correction,
since shifting *both* point sets by `(1/2, 1/2)` preserves every strict comparison; those keep
using `GridPoint.J`.

The grid differential reads marking indices the same way: its marking-avoidance predicate
`GridRectangle.AvoidsMarkings` tests the squares a rectangle covers, so a marking index names a
square there too.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.GridPoint.ICenter`: the ordered count of pairs of a grid point and a marked square with
  the point southwest of the center of the square, that is, `GridPoint.ICount` at the weak product
  order.
* `TauCeti.GridPoint.JNumCenter`, `TauCeti.GridPoint.JCenter`: the numerator and the
  rational-valued pairing of a set of grid points against a set of marked squares.
* `TauCeti.GridState.JNumCenterAt`: the singleton marking-pairing numerator contributed by one
  grid point.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.JO`, `TauCeti.GridDiagram.JX`: the pairings of a grid state against the
  `O`- and `X`-markings of a grid diagram.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.GridPoint.ICenter_graph_eq_card`, `TauCeti.GridState.JNumCenter_pointSet_eq_card`,
  `TauCeti.GridDiagram.JO_eq_card`, `TauCeti.GridDiagram.JX_eq_card`: the pairings as
  column-index counts.
* `TauCeti.GridState.JNumCenter_pointSet_eq_sum`: the marking-pairing numerator of a grid state as
  the sum of the singleton contributions from its grid points.
* `TauCeti.card_filter_le_eq_card_filter_lt_add_card_of_injective`,
  `TauCeti.GridState.ICenter_self_pointSet_eq_I_add_card`: weakening both comparisons of a
  column-pair count along an injective row assignment, in particular pairing a grid state against
  the squares it occupies, adds exactly the `n` diagonal pairs to the strict count.
* `TauCeti.GridPoint.JCenter_insert_pair_left`: the pairing is additive in the grid points, which
  is what localizes a grading change to the corners of a rectangle.

of their squares while a grid state sits on the grid lines is that of Ozsváth--Stipsicz--Szabó,
