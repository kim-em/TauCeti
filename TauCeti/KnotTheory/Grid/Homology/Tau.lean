# The invariant `τ` of a knot grid diagram

For a knot grid `G` over a commutative ring `K` of characteristic two, the unblocked grid
homology `GH⁻(G)` is a `K[U]`-module graded by the Alexander grading, on which `U` lowers the
degree by one; it is finitely generated when `K` is Noetherian. Its invariant `τ(G)` is minus
the largest Alexander degree of a homogeneous element that is not `K[U]`-torsion
(`GridDiagram.IsKnot.tau`). This is the definition of the
concordance invariant `τ` of Ozsváth--Stipsicz--Szabó, read on a single grid diagram: the
statement that `τ(G)` does not change under grid moves is the invariance of `GH⁻`, which is not
part of this file, so nothing here is a statement about the knot a diagram presents.

The definition is through `InternalGrading.supNonTorsionDegree`, the supremum of the non-torsion
degrees. Over a Noetherian `K`, when `GH⁻(G)` is not a torsion module that supremum is attained
(`GridDiagram.IsKnot.isGreatest_nonTorsionDegrees_neg_tau`), so `-τ(G)` is the Alexander degree
of a homogeneous non-torsion class and every such class has degree at most `-τ(G)`
(`GridDiagram.IsKnot.le_neg_tau`). If `GH⁻(G)` were torsion the supremum would be that of the
empty set, which Mathlib takes to be `0`.

Two transfer principles are recorded, which are the algebraic content of the inequalities
satisfied by `τ` under chain maps between grid complexes. A graded `K[U]`-isomorphism of
Alexander degree zero between the homologies of two knot grids identifies their invariants
(`GridDiagram.IsKnot.tau_eq_of_linearEquiv`); this is how an invariance theorem for `GH⁻` will
descend to `τ`. A homogeneous `K[U]`-linear map of Alexander degree `δ` from `GH⁻(G)` to
`GH⁻(G')` with a left inverse up to multiplication by a power of `U` satisfies
`τ(G') ≤ τ(G) - δ`, provided `K` is Noetherian and `GH⁻(G)` is not torsion
(`GridDiagram.IsKnot.tau_le_tau_sub_of_comp_eq_X_pow_smul`); the crossing change maps of
Ozsváth--Stipsicz--Szabó, Chapter 6, supply such pairs of maps in degrees `0` and `-1`, and the
resulting two inequalities bound the change of `τ` under a crossing change.

Finally, over a field, when the `X`-marking state `G.X` receives an even number of counted
rectangles from every grid state and has the largest Alexander grading of any grid state,
`τ(G) = -A(G.X)`
(`GridDiagram.IsKnot.tau_eq_neg_alexanderℤ_X`). The standard torus knot grids satisfy both
hypotheses; their values of `τ` are in `TorusLink/Tau.lean`.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.IsKnot.tau`: minus the maximal Alexander degree of a homogeneous
  non-torsion element of `GH⁻(G)`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.IsKnot.isGreatest_nonTorsionDegrees_neg_tau` and
  `TauCeti.GridDiagram.IsKnot.le_neg_tau`: over a Noetherian `K`, `-τ(G)` is the greatest
  non-torsion Alexander degree when `GH⁻(G)` is not torsion, and an upper bound for the
  non-torsion degrees without that hypothesis.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.IsKnot.tau_eq_of_linearEquiv`: a degree-zero graded `K[U]`-isomorphism
  of unblocked homologies identifies the invariants.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.IsKnot.tau_eq_of_semilinearMap`: so does a grading-preserving bijection
  that is semilinear along a ring homomorphism compatible with the evaluation `V_j ↦ U`.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.IsKnot.tau_le_tau_sub_of_comp_eq_X_pow_smul`: over a Noetherian `K`, a
  homogeneous map of degree `δ` out of a non-torsion `GH⁻(G)` with a left inverse up to a power
  of `U` gives `τ(G') ≤ τ(G) - δ`.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.IsKnot.tau_eq_neg_alexanderℤ_X`: `τ(G)` from the `X`-marking state when
  that state is a parity-protected cycle of maximal Alexander grading.

/-- **The invariant `τ` of a knot grid diagram**: minus the largest Alexander degree of a
homogeneous element of the unblocked grid homology `GH⁻(G)` that is not `K[U]`-torsion.

Over a Noetherian `K`, the supremum is attained as soon as `GH⁻(G)` is not a torsion module
(`isGreatest_nonTorsionDegrees_neg_tau`); if `GH⁻(G)` is torsion the value is `0`, the supremum
of the empty set. This is the invariant of the diagram; it is the
concordance invariant `τ` of the presented knot once the invariance of `GH⁻` under grid moves is
available (`tau_eq_of_linearEquiv`). -/
