# Pentagons turning on their initial side, and the commutation map

Let `b = finRotate n a`, and draw a column commutation of `G` as in `Commutation/Pentagon.lean`:
the vertical grid line `β` with index `b` is replaced by a curve `γ` meeting it at the turn point,
in square row `s`, where `γ` crosses from the left of `β` to its right going upwards, and at one
other point. The pentagons of `TauCeti.GridPentagonBetween` lie to the left of `β ∪ γ`: their
terminal side runs up `γ` to the turn point and then up `β`. The commutation map `Φ` of
Ozsváth--Stipsicz--Szabó also counts the empty pentagons lying to the right of `β ∪ γ`, whose
*initial* side runs up `β` to the turn point and then up `γ`.

Such a pentagon from a state `x` of `G` to a state `y` of `G'` starts at the point of `x` on
`β`, runs right along a horizontal circle to a point of `y`, up a vertical line to a point of `x`,
left along a horizontal circle to the point of `y` on `γ`, down `γ` to an intersection point of
`β` and `γ`, and down `β` back to the start. Convexity of the corner at the intersection point
forces it to be the same turn point as for the terminal-side pentagons. Its corners are those of
the oriented rectangle from `x` to `y` whose initial side is the line `b`, and the turn row must
lie among the rows that side spans (`TauCeti.GridInitialPentagonBetween`).

Away from columns `a` and `b` such a pentagon carries the markings of the underlying rectangle.
The column-`a` markings lie in the bigon below the turn point, between `γ` and `β`; the pentagon
contains such a marking exactly when it lies above the turn row, where its initial side runs
along `γ`. The column-`b` markings lie in the bigon above the turn point, between `β` and `γ`; the
pentagon contains such a marking exactly when it lies below the turn row, where its initial side
runs along `β`. These are the same two arcs as for a terminal-side pentagon
(`TauCeti.GridInitialPentagonBetween.coveredSquares`).

Both kinds of pentagon are needed. A rectangle followed by a terminal-side pentagon can make a
corner of angle `3π/2` at the turn point. Cutting that domain along the other curve through the
turn point decomposes it again, now as a rectangle followed by an initial-side pentagon. Without
the initial-side pentagons the pentagon-counting map is not a chain map. For example, take the
`4 × 4` diagram with `O = (0, 2, 1, 3)` and `X = (2, 3, 0, 1)`, commute columns `0` and `1`, and
use turn row `2` with the other intersection in row `0`. The identity state then has the diagonal
coefficient `V₁` in `Φ ∘ ∂⁻ - ∂⁻' ∘ Φ` when only terminal-side pentagons are counted. Counting
initial-side pentagons too gives a second rectangle--pentagon term with the same weight, so the
coefficient vanishes in characteristic two.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.GridInitialPentagonBetween`: the combinatorial shape of a pentagon turning on its
  initial side.
* `TauCeti.GridInitialPentagonBetween.coveredSquares`: the squares of `G` whose marking lies
  inside such a pentagon.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.initialPentagons`: the empty ones carrying no `X`-marking.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.initialPentagonWeight`, `TauCeti.GridDiagram.initialPentagonCoefficient`:
  their monomial weights and the resulting matrix coefficients.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.initialPentagonMap`: the map counting them.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.commutationMap`: the commutation map
  `Φ : GC⁻(G) → GC⁻(G.swapColumns a b)`, counting pentagons of both kinds.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.GridInitialPentagonBetween.nonempty_iff`: such a pentagon from `x` to `y` exists
  exactly when `y` is `x` with column `b` swapped against another column `j` and the turn row lies
  between the rows of `x` on `b` and on `j`; `Subsingleton` records that it is then unique.
* `TauCeti.GridInitialPentagonBetween.mem_coveredSquares_iff_of_ne`: away from columns `a` and `b`
  the covered squares are those of the underlying rectangle;
  `TauCeti.GridInitialPentagonBetween.mk_mem_coveredSquares_left_column` and
  `TauCeti.GridInitialPentagonBetween.mk_mem_coveredSquares_right_column` give them in those two
  columns.
* `TauCeti.GridInitialPentagonBetween.disjoint_coveredSquares_XSet_iff`: the `X`-avoidance
  condition column by column.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.commutationMap_apply_apply`: the matrix coefficients of `Φ` are the sums of
  those of the two pentagon maps.

/-- The combinatorial shape of a pentagon turning on its initial side, for columns `a` and
`finRotate n a`, with turn point in square row `s`, from a grid state `x` to a grid state `y`.

It is recorded by the oriented rectangle from `x` to `y` with the same corners, whose initial
side is the grid line `finRotate n a` together with the curve `γ` replacing it above the turn
point; the rows that side spans must contain the turn row. The points of `x` sit at the
lower-left corner, on `β`, and the upper-right corner; those of `y` at the upper-left corner, on
`γ`, and the lower-right corner. -/

/-- The commutation map `Φ : GC⁻(G) → GC⁻(G.swapColumns C.column (finRotate n C.column))` of the
validated column commutation `C`: it counts the empty pentagons carrying no `X`-marking with a
corner at the turn point, both those turning on their terminal side (`GridDiagram.pentagonMap`)
and those turning on their initial side (`GridDiagram.initialPentagonMap`). -/
