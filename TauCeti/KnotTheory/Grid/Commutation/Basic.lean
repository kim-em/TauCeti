# Grid diagram commutation moves

This file starts the commutation-move API for grid diagrams. The total row and column swap
operations used as underlying relabelings live in `TauCeti.KnotTheory.Grid.Diagram.Basic`, next to
the general row and column relabeling API. Here we add the move-specific hypothesis: two rows or
columns are commutable when their marking segments do not interleave around the torus.

For columns, the vertical segment in column `c` has endpoints `G.O c` and `G.X c`, and two columns
are non-interleaving when each pair of endpoints lies on one side of the other column's endpoint
pair. The row version is the same definition after reading, in each row, the unique columns
containing the `O` and `X` markings.

The predicates are intentionally just the combinatorial hypotheses. The pentagon-counting maps
and chain homotopies for commutation invariance are later Lane G.5 targets.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.columnArc`: the open cyclic interval between the two markings in a column.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.rowArc`: the open cyclic interval between the two markings in a row.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.ColumnsNoninterleaving`: the hypothesis for a column commutation.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.RowsNoninterleaving`: the hypothesis for a row commutation.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.columnsNoninterleaving_comm` and
  `TauCeti.GridDiagram.rowsNoninterleaving_comm`: non-interleaving is symmetric in the two rows or
  columns.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.rowsNoninterleaving_transpose` and
  `TauCeti.GridDiagram.columnsNoninterleaving_transpose`: diagonal reflection exchanges row and
  column non-interleaving.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.columnsNoninterleaving_of_X_eq_finRotate_O` and
  `TauCeti.GridDiagram.rowsNoninterleaving_of_X_eq_finRotate_O`: a column (or row) whose two
  markings are adjacent, with the `X`-marking cyclically after the `O`-marking, is
  non-interleaving with every column (or row).

This supplies a prerequisite for `TauCetiRoadmap/CombinatorialHeegaardFloer/README.md`, Lane G.5,
"Invariance over `𝔽₂`. Grid moves = commutation + (de)stabilization." It isolates the
non-interleaving condition for row and column commutations in the grid homology construction of

The condition is phrased in both directions: the two endpoints in column `a` lie on the same side
of the endpoint pair in column `b`, and conversely. This symmetric form is robust in degenerate
row-sharing cases, where one endpoint of a segment may have the same row coordinate as an endpoint
of the other segment. -/
