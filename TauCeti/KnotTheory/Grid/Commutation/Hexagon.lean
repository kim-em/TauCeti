# Hexagons of a column commutation, and the commutation homotopy

Let `b = finRotate n a` and draw a column commutation of `G` as in `Commutation/Pentagon.lean`:
the vertical grid line `β` with index `b` is replaced by a curve `γ` meeting it in two points. At
the turn point, in square row `t = C.turnRow`, the curve `γ` crosses from the left of `β` to its
right going upwards; at the other point, in square row `t' = C.oppositeTurnRow`, it crosses back.
Going up from `t'` to `t` the curve `γ` runs to the left of `β`, and this bigon contains both
markings of column `a`; going up from `t` to `t'` it runs to the right of `β`, and this bigon
contains both markings of column `b`.

The commutation map `Φ : GC⁻(G) → GC⁻(G')` counts pentagons turning at `t`, and the reverse map
`Ψ : GC⁻(G') → GC⁻(G)` counts pentagons turning at `t'`. The composite `Ψ ∘ Φ` is compared with
the identity by a homotopy `H : GC⁻(G) → GC⁻(G)` counting *hexagons*: embedded disks from a state
`x` of `G` to a state `y` of `G` bounded by arcs of horizontal circles, vertical circles, `β` and
`γ`, with convex corners at the four points of `x` and `y` and at both intersection points of `β`
and `γ`.

Convexity at the two intersection points leaves two kinds of hexagon.

* A hexagon whose terminal side runs up `β` to `t'`, up `γ` to `t` and up `β` again
  (`TauCeti.GridHexagonBetween`). It is the oriented rectangle from `x` to `y` with terminal side
  `b`, with the bigon from `t'` to `t` cut away; its rows must contain both intersection points,
  `t'` below `t`.
* A hexagon whose initial side runs up `β` to `t`, up `γ` to `t'` and up `β` again
  (`TauCeti.GridInitialHexagonBetween`). It is the oriented rectangle from `x` to `y` with initial
  side `b`, with the bigon from `t` to `t'` cut away; its rows must contain `t` below `t'`.

Both shapes are parametrised by the column `a` and the square rows `s`, `s'` of the lower and upper
ends of the bigon that is cut away. The interior lattice points of a hexagon are those of the
rectangle, so emptiness is `GridRectangleBetween.IsEmpty`. The markings a hexagon carries are those
of the rectangle except in the one column of the rectangle next to `β`: a hexagon of the first kind
carries no marking of column `a`, since the bigon it cuts away contains them all, and one of the
second kind carries no marking of column `b`. Its weight is the product of the variables of the
`O`-markings it carries; unlike for pentagons both states lie in `G`, so no renaming of variables
occurs.

Both kinds are needed, just as both kinds of pentagon are. For example, take the `5 × 5` diagram
with `O = (0, 3, 2, 1, 4)` and `X = (3, 0, 4, 2, 1)`, commute columns `2` and `3`, and use turn row
`4` with the other intersection in row `2`. Counting only hexagons of the first kind, the identity
state has diagonal coefficient `1` in `∂⁻ ∘ H + H ∘ ∂⁻ + 1 + Ψ ∘ Φ` over `𝔽₂`; counting both kinds
it vanishes.

`GridDiagram.hexagonMap` and `GridDiagram.initialHexagonMap` count the empty hexagons of the two
kinds carrying no `X`-marking, and `GridDiagram.commutationHomotopy` is their sum, the map `H`
above. That `∂⁻ ∘ H + H ∘ ∂⁻` is the identity plus `Ψ ∘ Φ` is not proved here;
`Commutation/Homotopy.lean` writes it as an identity between matrix coefficients.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.GridHexagonBetween`, `TauCeti.GridInitialHexagonBetween`: the combinatorial shapes of
  the two kinds of hexagon.
* `TauCeti.GridHexagonBetween.coveredSquares`, `TauCeti.GridInitialHexagonBetween.coveredSquares`:
  the squares of `G` whose marking lies inside such a hexagon.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.hexagons`, `TauCeti.GridDiagram.initialHexagons`: the empty hexagons
  carrying no `X`-marking.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.hexagonWeight`, `TauCeti.GridDiagram.hexagonCoefficient` and their initial
  versions: the monomial weights and the matrix coefficients.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.hexagonMap`, `TauCeti.GridDiagram.initialHexagonMap`: the maps
  `GC⁻(G) → GC⁻(G)` counting each kind.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.commutationHomotopy`: their sum.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.GridHexagonBetween.nonempty_iff`, `TauCeti.GridInitialHexagonBetween.nonempty_iff`: a
  hexagon from `x` to `y` exists exactly when `y` is `x` with column `b` swapped against another
  column and the rows of `x` on the two columns enclose the bigon in the right order;
  `Subsingleton` records that it is then unique.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.OColumns_toGridRectangle_eq_insert_of_hexagon` and its initial version:
  the rectangle under a hexagon carries one more `O`-marking, that of the cut-off column.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.XSet_inter_toGridRectangle_coveredSquares_of_disjoint_hexagon` and its
  initial version: the rectangle under a hexagon carrying no `X`-marking carries exactly one
  `X`-marking, that of the cut-off column.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.commutationHomotopy_apply_apply`: the matrix coefficients of the
  commutation homotopy.

## References

The hexagons are those of the homotopy `H_{βγβ}` of Manolescu--Ozsváth--Szabó--Thurston, *On
combinatorial link Floer homology*, Section 3.1 (arXiv:math/0610559), and of the homotopy of
Ozsváth--Stipsicz--Szabó, *Grid Homology for Knots and Links*, Section 5.1. The orientation
convention matches the rectangles of `TauCeti.GridRectangleBetween`: the source state occupies the
lower-left and upper-right corners.

/-- The combinatorial shape of a hexagon whose terminal side turns at both intersection points, for
columns `a` and `finRotate n a`, cutting away the bigon from square row `s` up to square row `s'`,
from a grid state `x` to a grid state `y`.

It is recorded by the oriented rectangle from `x` to `y` with the same corners, whose terminal side
is the grid line `finRotate n a`; the rows that side spans must contain the lower intersection row
`s` and, above it, the upper intersection row `s'`. A hexagon-counting map only uses these shapes
through `GridDiagram.ColumnCommutationData`, which places the column-`a` markings in the bigon. -/
