# Rectangles in grid diagrams

The grid lives on a torus, so the basic one-dimensional ingredient of a rectangle is the circular
interval in `Fin n`. A grid rectangle carries two finite coordinate sets built from such intervals:
its `interior`, the product of two open intervals, records the grid points strictly inside and
is what a grid state must avoid for the rectangle to be empty; its `coveredSquares`, the product
of two half-open intervals, records the region the rectangle covers and is what must avoid the
`O` and `X` markings.

The final section packages an oriented rectangle from one grid state to another: two columns
where the states exchange rows, and agreement everywhere else. This is the shape counted by
the grid differential; the `IsEmptyFor` and `AvoidsMarkings` predicates record the two
finite-set disjointness conditions used for empty rectangles and marking-avoiding rectangles.

`AvoidsMarkings` tests `coveredSquares`, so a marking counts as covered exactly when its square
lies under the rectangle: marking indices are the southwest corners of square-centred markings,
the convention the Maslov and Alexander gradings use. `Rectangle/Squares.lean` develops the
covered squares further for the gradings.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.GridRectangle`: a toroidal rectangle, represented by its four cyclic sides.
* `TauCeti.GridRectangle.transpose`: the diagonal reflection of a toroidal rectangle, exchanging
  the column and row sides.
* `TauCeti.GridRectangle.interior`: the finite set of grid points strictly inside the rectangle.
* `TauCeti.GridRectangle.coveredSquares`: the finite set of squares the rectangle covers, each
  named by its lower-left grid point.
* `TauCeti.GridRectangle.IsEmptyFor`: a toroidal rectangle is empty for a grid state when no point
  of the state lies in its interior.
* `TauCeti.GridRectangle.AvoidsMarkings`: a toroidal rectangle avoids a grid diagram's markings
  when no `O` or `X` marking lies in a square it covers.
* `TauCeti.GridRectangleBetween`: an oriented rectangle from one grid state to another.
* `TauCeti.GridRectangleBetween.toGridRectangle`: the toroidal rectangle of an oriented rectangle,
  with the same side columns and with the source-state rows in those columns as its horizontal
  sides.
* `TauCeti.GridRectangleBetween.IsEmpty`: an oriented rectangle is empty when its toroidal
  rectangle is empty for the source state.
* `TauCeti.GridRectangleBetween.swapSides`: the other oriented rectangle from `x` to `y` on the same
  two side columns, which runs along the complementary column arc and the complementary row arc.
* `TauCeti.GridRectangleBetween.transpose`: the diagonal reflection of an oriented rectangle, from
  `x.transpose` to `y.transpose`.
* `TauCeti.GridRectangleBetween.transposeEquiv`: the diagonal reflection packaged as an involutive
  equivalence with oriented rectangles from `x.transpose` to `y.transpose`.
* `TauCeti.GridRectangleBetween.emptyRectangles`: the empty rectangles from `x` to `y`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.GridRectangle.isEmptyFor_iff_forall_notMem_cIoo`: emptiness of a toroidal rectangle
  for a grid state, quantified over the columns strictly inside it, and
  `TauCeti.GridRectangleBetween.isEmpty_iff_forall_notMem_cIoo`, its form for an oriented
  rectangle and its source state, with
  `TauCeti.GridRectangleBetween.isEmpty_iff_forall_notMem_cIoo_target` the same test read through
  the target state.
* `TauCeti.GridRectangleBetween.isEmpty_of_right_eq_finRotate`: a rectangle one column wide is
  empty.
* `TauCeti.GridRectangle.avoidsMarkings_iff_forall`: marking avoidance tested column by column.

## References

The encoding follows the toroidal grid-diagram convention from Ozsváth--Stipsicz--Szabó, *Grid
Homology for Knots and Links*, Chapter 3. Rectangles connecting two grid states, `Rect(x, y)`, and
the empty ones among them, `Rect°(x, y)` (Definition 4.2.1), are in Chapter 4, Section 4.2; the
marking-avoidance condition defining the fully blocked complex is in Section 4.4.
