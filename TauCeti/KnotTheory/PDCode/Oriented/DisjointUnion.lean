# Disjoint unions of oriented diagrams

Disjoint union retains each component's direction, including the directions on crossing-free
circles. Crossing signs are unchanged, and writhe is additive. Consequently the writhe-normalized
Kauffman bracket has the same disjoint-union formula as the unoriented bracket. This is the
formula used to transport an invariant local replacement of an isolated diagram into an arbitrary
surrounding diagram.
