# The Kauffman bracket of a PD-code

Smoothing every crossing of a diagram in one of its two ways turns the diagram into a disjoint
union of circles. A **state** of a PD-code with `n` crossings is such a choice at each crossing,
recorded as `s : Fin n → Bool`, with `s i = true` selecting the `A`-smoothing at crossing `i`:
the smoothing that turns left off the over-strand, equivalently the one joining the two regions
swept out when the over-strand is rotated counterclockwise. With the four slots of a crossing in
counterclockwise order that smoothing takes each over-slot to the preceding slot, which is
`TauCeti.PDCode.slotSmoothing` applied to the code's own over-pair indicator; the `B`-smoothing
is the same construction applied to the complementary indicator.

Reconnecting the half-edges accordingly gives `TauCeti.PDCode.statePerm`, the traversal of the
smoothed diagram: cross an arc, then follow the smoothing at the crossing reached. Exactly as for
`TauCeti.PDCode.componentPerm`, each circle of the smoothed diagram carries two of its orbits, one
for each direction of travel, so `TauCeti.PDCode.stateLoopCount` halves the orbit count and adds
the crossing-free circles that the code records separately.

The **Kauffman bracket** is the resulting state sum `∑ s, a ^ (A(s) - B(s)) * δ ^ (loops s - 1)`,
formed
over a commutative ring with a distinguished unit `a` at the loop value
`δ = -(a ^ 2 + a⁻¹ ^ 2)` (`TauCeti.TemperleyLieb.jonesDelta`), which is the value at which the
Kauffman-bracket expansion of a crossing is invertible. This is Kauffman's `⟨·⟩` with Lickorish's
normalisation `⟨unknot⟩ = 1`: a code with no crossings and `c ≥ 1` circles has bracket
`δ ^ (c - 1)`. The exponent is truncated subtraction, so the empty code has bracket `1`; every
code with a crossing has at least one circle in each state (`TauCeti.PDCode.one_le_stateLoopCount`),
so this affects only the empty code.

The bracket depends on a PD-code only through its relabelling class, and mirroring a code inverts
the unit `a`. On the one-crossing kink diagram `TauCeti.PDCode.kink` it takes the value
`-a ^ 3`, the framing factor of the first Reidemeister move. Whether the bracket descends from
diagrams to knots is the question of its behaviour under the Reidemeister moves, which are
separate constructions on PD-codes; the first move is in
`TauCeti/KnotTheory/PDCode/Reidemeister/One.lean`.

For an oriented PD-code, `TauCeti.OrientedPDCode.normalizedKauffmanBracket` multiplies the bracket
by the writhe correction `(-a ^ 3) ^ (-writhe)`. This is the normalization used to obtain the
Jones polynomial from the bracket.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.PDCode.smoothingTurn`: the reconnection of the half-edges smoothing every crossing.
* `TauCeti.PDCode.smoothingChoice`: the over-pair indicator a state selects at each crossing.
* `TauCeti.PDCode.statePerm`: the traversal of the smoothed diagram.
* `TauCeti.PDCode.stateLoopCount`: the number of circles of the smoothed diagram.
* `TauCeti.PDCode.stateWeight`: the weight `a ^ (A(s) - B(s))` of a state.
* `TauCeti.PDCode.kauffmanBracket`: the Kauffman bracket state sum.
* `TauCeti.OrientedPDCode.normalizedKauffmanBracket`: the writhe-normalized bracket.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.PDCode.even_orbitCount_statePerm`: the traversal orbits of a smoothed diagram come in
  pairs, and `TauCeti.PDCode.one_le_stateLoopCount`: a code with a crossing leaves at least one
  circle in every state.
* `TauCeti.PDCode.kauffmanBracket_relabel`: the bracket is invariant under relabelling.
* `TauCeti.PDCode.kauffmanBracket_mirror`: mirroring the code inverts the unit.
* `TauCeti.PDCode.kauffmanBracket_eq_jonesDelta_pow`: a code with no crossings and `c` circles has
  bracket `δ ^ (c - 1)`.
* `TauCeti.PDCode.stateLoopCount_kink_true`, `TauCeti.PDCode.stateLoopCount_kink_false`: the two
  smoothings of a kink leave two circles and one circle.
* `TauCeti.PDCode.kauffmanBracket_kink`: the kink diagram has bracket `-a ^ 3`.

/-! ### Codes with one crossing more

Let `D'` be a code with one crossing more than `D`, whose first `n` crossings keep the half-edges
and over-strands of `D`, and whose last crossing takes the four new half-edge positions and has
over-pair indicator `b`. Crossing insertion and the first Reidemeister move build such codes. A
state of `D'` is a state of `D` together with a choice at the new crossing, and the lemmas below
split its smoothing accordingly. -/

/-- **The Kauffman bracket of the kink is `-a ^ 3`**, that is, `-a ^ 3` times that of the unknot.
The two smoothings of the single crossing contribute `a * δ` and `a⁻¹`, and the loop value
collapses their sum to `-a ^ 3`: this is the framing factor by which the bracket fails to be
invariant under the first Reidemeister move. -/
