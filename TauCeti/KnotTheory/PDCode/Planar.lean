# Faces and planarity of PD-codes

A `TauCeti.PDCode` lists the four half-edges at each crossing in counterclockwise order and pairs
the two ends of each arc, but nothing in the code forces these data to come from a diagram drawn
in the plane. This file supplies the face data that decides it. The half-edges of a code are the
darts of its underlying `4`-valent graph, the counterclockwise rotation of the slots at each
crossing (`TauCeti.PDCode.crossingRotation`) is its rotation system, and the arc matching is its
edge involution. As for any rotation system, the orbits of the composite `TauCeti.PDCode.facePerm`,
which turns to the next slot counterclockwise and then runs along the arc from there, are the faces
of the closed oriented surface on which the graph is cellularly embedded
(Lando–Zvonkin, §1.3). For a connected diagram in the plane they are the regions of the diagram.

This is the permutation-triple encoding of the graph: `TauCeti.PDCode.toPermutationTriple` has
the crossing rotation and the arc matching as its first two components and the inverse face
permutation as the third. Its Euler characteristic counts `n` vertices, `2 * n` edges and the
faces, so it is `faceCount - n` (`TauCeti.PDCode.eulerChar_toPermutationTriple`). Each connected
component of the graph contributes at most `2`, with equality exactly for a sphere, so a code is
**planar** (`TauCeti.PDCode.IsPlanar`) when the Euler characteristic is twice the number of
connected components, the monodromy orbits of the triple. For a connected code this is Euler's
count of `n + 2` regions (`TauCeti.PDCode.isPlanar_iff_faceCount_eq_of_isConnected`).

Throughout, the underlying graph is the one supported on the crossings: its vertices are the
crossings and its edges the arcs between them. The crossing-free circles of a code
(`TauCeti.PDCode.crossinglessComponentCount`) are not part of it, so they contribute neither faces
to `TauCeti.PDCode.faceCount` nor connected components to the monodromy orbits. They play no part
in planarity either, since a circle alone always lies in a sphere.

Planarity is invariant under mirroring and relabelling. The one-crossing kink is planar, while the
one-crossing code whose arcs join opposite slots, two circles meeting in a single crossing, is not
(`TauCeti.PDCode.exists_not_isPlanar`): its graph embeds only in the torus.

The face permutation locates the arcs that border a common region: two half-edges lie on the same
face exactly when `TauCeti.PDCode.face` agrees on them (`TauCeti.PDCode.face_eq_face_iff`). This
is the locality data that the second and third Reidemeister moves need beyond the algebraic
operation `TauCeti.PDCode.insertClasp`.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.PDCode.crossingRotation`: the counterclockwise rotation of the slots at each crossing.
* `TauCeti.PDCode.toPermutationTriple`: the permutation triple of the underlying graph.
* `TauCeti.PDCode.facePerm` and `TauCeti.PDCode.faceCount`: the face traversal and the number of
  faces of the underlying graph.
* `TauCeti.PDCode.Face` and `TauCeti.PDCode.face`: the faces, as orbits of the face traversal, and
  the face at a half-edge.
* `TauCeti.PDCode.IsPlanar`: every connected component of the underlying graph is a sphere.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.PDCode.eulerChar_toPermutationTriple`: the Euler characteristic is `faceCount - n`.
* `TauCeti.PDCode.faceCount_le`: if the underlying graph has `c` connected components, it has at
  most `n + 2 * c` faces, with equality exactly for planar codes
  (`TauCeti.PDCode.isPlanar_iff_faceCount_eq`).
* `TauCeti.PDCode.mem_orbit_of_face_eq_face`: half-edges on one face lie in one connected
  component, and so does a half-edge `h` with every half-edge on the face at the far end
  `D.edgePair.val h` of its arc (`TauCeti.PDCode.mem_orbit_of_face_edgePair_eq_face`).
* `TauCeti.PDCode.isPlanar_mirror` and `TauCeti.PDCode.isPlanar_relabel`: invariance.
* `TauCeti.PDCode.isPlanar_kink` and `TauCeti.PDCode.exists_not_isPlanar`.
