# Crossing data for free cancellation in braid closures

An inverse pair inserted at the top of a braid word contributes a Reidemeister-II clasp to its
closure.  This file records the local crossing data needed by the eventual diagrammatic
identification: old crossings retain their signs, and the two new crossings have opposite signs
and opposite over-pair indicators.  The existing `DoubleCrossing` API supplies the two internal
arcs; the remaining closure theorem must match the external arcs with a `PDCode.insertClasp` and
prove its face condition.

The pair is appended so its crossing names are the final two `Fin` indices.  This is the numbering
used by `PDCode.insertClasp`, and lets later proofs compare old blocks by `Fin.castAdd 2`.
