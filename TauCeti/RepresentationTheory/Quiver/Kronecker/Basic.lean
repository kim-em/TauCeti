# The generalized Kronecker quiver

The generalized Kronecker quiver has two vertices, a source and a target, and one arrow from the
source to the target for each element of an arrow type `A`. Taking `A = Fin 2` gives the
*Kronecker quiver* `• ⇉ •`, the smallest connected acyclic quiver that is not of Dynkin type and
hence the boundary case of Gabriel's theorem; `A = Fin 1` gives the `A₂` quiver `• → •`. (Dropping
acyclicity there would be wrong: the one-loop quiver of
`TauCeti.RepresentationTheory.Quiver.OneLoop.Basic` is connected, smaller, and not of Dynkin
type.)

This file constructs the quiver and classifies its paths: it is acyclic, and its only nontrivial
paths are the arrows themselves. The dimension of its path algebra is computed in
`TauCeti.RepresentationTheory.Quiver.Kronecker.PathAlgebra`, its Euler and Tits forms in
`TauCeti.RepresentationTheory.Quiver.Kronecker.EulerForm`. Its representations are built in
`TauCeti.RepresentationTheory.Quiver.Kronecker.Representation`, and its representation type --
infinite as soon as there are two arrows -- is settled in
`TauCeti.RepresentationTheory.Quiver.Kronecker.FiniteRepType`.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.Quiver.Kronecker A`: the vertex type, with constructors `src` and `tgt` and a `Quiver`
  instance whose only arrows are `src ⟶ tgt`, indexed by `A`.
* `TauCeti.Quiver.Kronecker.arrow`: the arrow attached to an element of the arrow type.
* `TauCeti.Quiver.Kronecker.vertexEquiv`: the two vertices as indices in `Fin 2`, the target first.
* `TauCeti.Quiver.Kronecker.pathEquivArrow`: the paths from `src` to `tgt` are the arrows.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Quiver.Kronecker.isAcyclic`: the quiver is acyclic, since all of its arrows run the
  same way.
* `TauCeti.Quiver.Kronecker.card_path_src_tgt`: there are as many paths from the source to the
  target as there are arrows.

The order is the one that makes the path algebra upper triangular rather than lower triangular. In
`TauCeti.RepresentationTheory.Quiver.Kronecker.UpperTriangular` a path is sent to the matrix unit
in the row of its target and the column of its source, because an arrow acts on a left module from
its source to its target; so the arrows, all of which run from `src` to `tgt`, occupy entries above
the diagonal exactly when `tgt` comes first. -/
