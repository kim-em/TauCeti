# The path-length grading of the preprojective algebra

Every preprojective relator of a quiver is homogeneous for the path-length grading of the path
algebra of the doubled quiver: the head backtrack and the tail backtrack of an arrow are the
basis elements of single length-two paths, so the local relator at a vertex and the global
relator are differences of sums of degree-two elements. Consequently the preprojective relation
ideal is homogeneous.

Because the relation ideal is homogeneous, the generic descent
`TauCeti.GradedAlgebra.quotientPiece` applies to it: the preprojective algebra `Pi_k(Q)` carries the
induced path-length grading `TauCeti.preprojectiveGrade`, in which the vertex idempotents have
degree `0`, the doubled arrows degree `1`, and the relator degree `2`. This file packages the
graded-algebra structure and computes the concrete pieces.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.preprojectiveGrade`: the induced degree-`n` piece on the preprojective algebra, the
  descent of `TauCeti.PathAlgebra.grade` along the quotient map `TauCeti.preprojectiveMk`.
* `TauCeti.preprojectiveGradedAlgebra`: **the preprojective algebra is a graded algebra** for the
  induced path-length grading.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.headBacktrackElem_mem_grade_two` and `TauCeti.tailBacktrackElem_mem_grade_two`: the
  two backtracks of an arrow have degree two.
* `TauCeti.localPreprojectiveRelator_mem_grade_two` and
  `TauCeti.preprojectiveRelator_mem_grade_two`: the local and global relators have degree two.
* `TauCeti.signlessPreprojectiveRelator_mem_grade_two`: so does the signless local relator.
* `TauCeti.isHomogeneous_preprojectiveIdeal`: **the preprojective relation ideal is
  homogeneous.**
* `TauCeti.preprojectiveMk_ofArrow_mul_mem_iSup`: left multiplication by an arrow lands in
  positive degree.
* `TauCeti.isInternal_preprojectiveGrade`: **the preprojective algebra is the internal direct
  sum of its graded pieces**, the comparison of the direct-sum graded algebra with the ungraded
  quotient rather than with a separate graded copy.
* `TauCeti.preprojectiveGrade_zero_eq_span_range_vertexIdempotent` and
  `TauCeti.preprojectiveGrade_one_eq_span_range_ofArrow`: degree `0` is spanned by the vertex
  idempotent classes and degree `1` by the doubled arrow classes.
* `TauCeti.preprojectiveGrade_eq_span_range_ofPath`: every piece is spanned by the classes of the
  paths of its degree.
