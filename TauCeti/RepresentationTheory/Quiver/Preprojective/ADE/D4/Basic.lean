# The preprojective algebra of `D₄` is finite-dimensional

In the Bourbaki labelling of `D₄` the vertex `1` is trivalent and `0, 2, 3` are leaves, so every
path of the doubled quiver alternates between the trivalent vertex and the leaves. Write `u_l` for
the arrow `l → 1` and `d_l` for the arrow `1 → l`. In the signless algebra
`TauCeti.signlessPreprojectiveAlgebra` of the doubled graph, the relation at a leaf `l` is the
single backtrack `d_l u_l = 0`, and the relation at the trivalent vertex is
`u_0 d_0 + u_2 d_2 + u_3 d_3 = 0`. With only three leaves these relations force

```text
(u_a d_a) (u_b d_b) u_c = 0    and    d_c (u_b d_b) (u_a d_a) = 0
```

for all leaves `a, b, c`, and every path of length five is one of these two words. Hence **every
path of length at least five vanishes**. This is a computation with the relations alone; with a
fourth leaf, as in affine `D₄`, it fails, and the preprojective algebra is infinite-dimensional
(`TauCeti.AffineDynkinType.not_module_finite_preprojectiveAlgebra`).

The signless algebra of a bipartite graph is the preprojective algebra of each of its orientations,
by an explicit sign rescaling of the arrows. Thus the same bound holds in the preprojective algebra
`Π_k(Q)` of every orientation `Q` of `D₄`, over every commutative ring; the relation ideal is
admissible, and `Π_k(Q)` is finite-dimensional over every field. The bound five is `h - 1` for the
Coxeter number `h = 6` of `D₄`; that paths of length four survive is not proved here.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.signlessPreprojectiveMk_D4_ofPath_eq_zero_of_five_le`: paths of length at least five
  vanish in the signless algebra of `D₄`.
* `TauCeti.preprojectiveMk_D4_ofPath_eq_zero_of_five_le`: the same in the preprojective algebra of
  every orientation of `D₄`.
* `TauCeti.isAdmissibleIdeal_preprojectiveIdeal_D4`: the preprojective relation ideal of every
  orientation of `D₄` is admissible.
* `TauCeti.instFiniteDimensionalPreprojectiveAlgebraD4` and
  `TauCeti.instFiniteDimensionalSignlessPreprojectiveAlgebraD4`: the preprojective algebra of
  every orientation of `D₄`, and the signless algebra of `D₄`, are finite-dimensional.
