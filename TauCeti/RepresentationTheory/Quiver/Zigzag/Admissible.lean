# The zigzag relation ideal is admissible

Let `R` be the arrow ideal of the path algebra of the doubled quiver of a finite simple graph `G`.
The uniform zigzag relation ideal is squeezed between `R ^ 3` and `R ^ 2`: every uniform relator
is a combination of paths of length at least two, and every path of length at least three is
itself a relator. So the zigzag ideal is an admissible ideal, and the zigzag relation quotient is a
bound quiver algebra in the sense of `TauCeti.IsAdmissibleIdeal`, for every finite simple graph.

The lower bound is what makes the image of the arrow ideal cube-zero: whenever the quadratic
relators already lie in `R ^ 3` (as happens for the one-edge graph `A₂`, where they all vanish),
the zigzag ideal is exactly `R ^ 3`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.arrowIdeal_pow_three_le_zigzagIdeal`: `R ^ 3` lies in the zigzag ideal.
* `TauCeti.zigzagIdeal_le_arrowIdeal_sq`: the zigzag ideal lies in `R ^ 2`.
* `TauCeti.isAdmissibleIdeal_zigzagIdeal`: the zigzag ideal is admissible.
* `TauCeti.zigzagIdeal_eq_arrowIdeal_pow_three`: if every quadratic relator lies in `R ^ 3`, the
  zigzag ideal is `R ^ 3`.
* `TauCeti.instFiniteDimensionalNonisolatedZigzagQuotient`: the zigzag relation quotient is
  finite-dimensional over a field.
