# The extended Dynkin quiver of type `D~`

For `m : ℕ`, the quiver `TauCeti.Quiver.AffineD m` has a *spine* of `m + 1` vertices
`spine 0 → spine 1 → ⋯ → spine m`, joined by one arrow from each spine vertex to the next, and
four *leaves*: the leaves `0` and `1` each carry one arrow into the first spine vertex `spine 0`,
and the leaves `2` and `3` each carry one arrow into the last spine vertex `spine m`. Its
underlying graph is the extended Dynkin diagram `D~ₘ₊₄`, on `m + 5` vertices, in one fixed
orientation. For `m = 0` the spine is a single vertex receiving all four arrows, and the quiver is
the four subspace quiver `TauCeti.Quiver.Subspace (Fin 4)` of the extended Dynkin diagram `D~₄`.

This file carries the vertex and arrow data, and the shape of the underlying graph: it is a tree,
with at most one arrow between any two vertices, because every vertex is the source of at most one
arrow and every arrow moves towards `spine m`. The representation theory, that the quiver has
infinite representation type, is in `TauCeti.RepresentationTheory.Quiver.AffineD.FiniteRepType`.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.Quiver.AffineD`: the vertex type, with constructors `leaf` and `spine`, and a `Quiver`
  instance.
* `TauCeti.Quiver.AffineD.vertexEquiv`: the vertices as `Fin 4 ⊕ Fin (m + 1)`, so that there are
  `m + 5` of them (`TauCeti.Quiver.AffineD.card_eq`).
* `TauCeti.Quiver.AffineD.leafTarget`: the spine vertex a leaf is attached to.
* `TauCeti.Quiver.AffineD.leafArrow` and `TauCeti.Quiver.AffineD.spineArrow`: the arrow from a
  leaf into the spine, and the arrow from a spine vertex to the next one.
