# Short projective resolutions over acyclic path algebras

Every finite-length module over the path algebra of a finite acyclic quiver has
projective dimension at most one. Indeed, every simple module is a vertex simple,
whose first-arrow resolution has length one, and this bound is preserved by
extensions. In particular the result applies to every module finite-dimensional over
the coefficient field.

Applying `TauCeti.projective_projectiveShortComplex_X₁` to either bound shows that the
standard free presentation has projective kernel and is a length-one projective
resolution. Its terms need not be finitely generated. These resolutions allow Ext
computations to stop at degree one.

The simple-module classification and first-arrow resolutions are those of
`TauCeti.RepresentationTheory.Quiver.Representation.VertexSimpleModule`.
