# Symmetrified quivers

Mathlib's `Quiver.Symmetrify` doubles a quiver by adjoining a formal reverse to every arrow,
with the same vertices as the original quiver. This file transfers finiteness and decidable
equality to the doubled vertex type, supplies finite arrow types from those of the original
quiver, and records that the inclusion is bijective on vertices. These facts let path-algebra
constructions on the doubled quiver reuse the original finite vertex and arrow data.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.symmetrify_of_obj`: the doubling inclusion is the identity on vertices.
* `TauCeti.symmetrify_of_obj_bijective`: the doubling inclusion is bijective on vertices.
