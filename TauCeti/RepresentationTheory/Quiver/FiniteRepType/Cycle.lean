# Cycles in the underlying graph obstruct finite representation type

A cycle `x 0, x 1, …, x (n + 2)` of pairwise distinct vertices of a quiver `Q`, with an arrow in
one direction or the other between each `x i` and `x (i + 1)` and between `x (n + 2)` and `x 0`,
is the extended Dynkin diagram `Ã_{n+2}` in some orientation. This file shows that, whatever the
orientation, `Q` then has infinite representation type over every field
(`TauCeti.not_isFiniteRepType_of_injective_of_nonempty_hom_sum`).

The infinite family lives on the full subquiver of `Q` on the vertices of the cycle. Its `r`-th
member puts the truncated polynomial algebra `k[X]/(Xʳ⁺¹)` at every vertex of the cycle; an arrow
between `x (n + 2)` and `x 0`, in either direction, acts by multiplication by `X`, and every other
arrow by the identity. Naturality along the arrows of the cycle other than the closing one forces
an endomorphism to have the same component at every vertex, whatever their directions, and
naturality along the closing arrow then says that this common component commutes with
multiplication by `X`. So the endomorphism is multiplication by an element of the local ring
`k[X]/(Xʳ⁺¹)`, and the representation is indecomposable; its dimension vector is constant equal
to `r + 1` on the cycle, so different members are non-isomorphic.

Read through the underlying graph, this says that a quiver of finite representation type has a
forest as underlying graph (`TauCeti.IsFiniteRepType.isAcyclic_underlyingGraph`): the cycles of
length at least three are the copies of `SimpleGraph.cycleGraph`, which Mathlib's
`SimpleGraph.isAcyclic_iff_free_cycleGraph` identifies as the obstructions to acyclicity. With the
tree case of Gabriel's dichotomy (`TauCeti.IsFiniteRepType.posDef_titsForm_of_isTree`) this gives
the dichotomy's converse half for every finite connected quiver with finitely many arrows between
any two vertices
(`TauCeti.IsFiniteRepType.posDef_titsForm_of_connected`).

## Main results

* `TauCeti.not_isFiniteRepType_of_injective_of_nonempty_hom_sum`: a cycle of length at least three,
  in any orientation, obstructs finite representation type.
* `TauCeti.not_isFiniteRepType_of_copy_cycleGraph`: so does a copy of `SimpleGraph.cycleGraph` in
  the underlying graph.
* `TauCeti.IsFiniteRepType.isAcyclic_underlyingGraph`: the underlying graph of a quiver of finite
  representation type is acyclic.
* `TauCeti.IsFiniteRepType.posDef_titsForm_of_connected`: **a finite connected quiver of finite
  representation type has a positive definite Tits form.**

## Implementation notes

The cycles here have length at least three because that is what the underlying simple graph can
see: a cycle of length two is a pair of opposite arrows `a ⟶ b`, `b ⟶ a`, which the underlying
graph records as a single edge, and a cycle of length one is a loop, excluded already by
`TauCeti.IsFiniteRepType.isEmpty_hom_self`. The two-cycle obstruction is proved separately in
`TauCeti.RepresentationTheory.Quiver.FiniteRepType.TwoCycle`. Length three is also what the
construction below needs: the closing edge must be the only edge of the cycle joining
`x (n + 2)` and `x 0`, so that the other arrows can act by the identity.

The construction and the indecomposability argument adapt the nilpotent Jordan blocks on the
one-loop quiver in `TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Quiver/OneLoop/FiniteRepType.lean`
(`oneLoopNilpotentRepApp_root_mul` and `TauCeti.indecomposable_oneLoopNilpotentRep`), with the
loop spread out around the cycle.

The statements are for representations with vertex spaces in the universe of the base field, the
universe in which the truncated polynomial algebras live.
