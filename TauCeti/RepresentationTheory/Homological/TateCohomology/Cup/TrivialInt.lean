# Cup product with trivial integral coefficients in degree zero

The canonical class of `1` acts as the identity under cup product after removing the left tensor
unit. Consequently, cup product with a generating class is bijective when the target has the
order of the finite group.

These Tate cohomology operations are parameterized by a representation and live alongside the
generic cup product in `TauCeti.TateCohomology`.
