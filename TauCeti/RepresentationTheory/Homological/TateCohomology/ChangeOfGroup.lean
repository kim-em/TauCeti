# Change of group in positive Tate degrees

Let `φ : G →* Q` be a homomorphism of finite groups, `M` a representation of `Q`, `N` a
representation of `G` and `f : Res_φ M ⟶ N` a morphism of `G`-representations. Ordinary group
cohomology has the change-of-group map `groupCohomology.map φ f n : Hⁿ(Q, M) ⟶ Hⁿ(G, N)`. In
positive degrees Mathlib identifies Tate cohomology with ordinary cohomology, and this file
transports the change-of-group map across that identification as `TauCeti.TateCohomology.posMap`.

Positive-degree restriction to a subgroup (`TauCeti.TateCohomology.posRes`: `φ` the inclusion,
`f` the identity) and inflation from a quotient (`TauCeti.TateCohomology.infl`: `φ` the quotient
map, `f` the inclusion of invariants) are both of this form. In degree zero there is no such map
in general: for a surjective `φ` the norm of `G` on `Res_φ M` is `|ker φ|` times the norm of `Q`,
so a norm of `Q` need not be a norm of `G`, and the quotient of invariants by norms does not map
along the identity of invariants.

The change-of-group map is natural in both coefficient representations (`posMap_comp_map`,
`map_comp_posMap`), and it commutes with the connecting maps of short exact sequences
(`δ_comp_posMap`). The degree-zero source of a connecting map is a quotient of the ordinary
invariants, so the compatibility is stated on ordinary cohomology classes through the comparison
`Rep.fromGroupCohomology`, which also covers the connecting map from degree zero to degree one
(`fromGroupCohomology_δ_comp_posMap`). This is what allows a statement about change of group to
be moved across degrees by dimension shifting, as in the compatibility of the Tate cup product
with inflation.

For integral coefficients, change of group along the identity of `ℤ` carries the connecting class
`δχ ∈ H²(Q, ℤ)` of a character `χ` of `Q` to the connecting class of its pullback `χ ∘ φ` to `G`
(`posMap_characterConnectingClass`). For `φ` a quotient map this is the compatibility of `δχ`
with inflation.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.TateCohomology.posMap`: the change-of-group map in a positive Tate degree.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.TateCohomology.fromGroupCohomology_comp_posMap`: through the comparison with ordinary
  cohomology, `posMap` is `groupCohomology.map`.
* `TauCeti.TateCohomology.posMap_comp_map`, `TauCeti.TateCohomology.map_comp_posMap`: naturality
  in the two coefficient representations.
* `TauCeti.TateCohomology.posMap_id`, `TauCeti.TateCohomology.posMap_comp`: functoriality in the
  group homomorphism.
* `TauCeti.TateCohomology.fromGroupCohomology_δ_comp_posMap`,
  `TauCeti.TateCohomology.δ_comp_posMap`: compatibility with connecting maps.
* `TauCeti.TateCohomology.posMap_characterConnectingClass`: change of group carries the connecting
  class of a character to the connecting class of its pullback.
