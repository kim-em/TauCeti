# Shapiro's lemma in degrees zero, one and two

For a profinite group `G`, a **closed** subgroup `U` and a discrete `U`-module `A`, the coinduced
module `Coind_U^G A` of `TauCeti.DiscreteCoind` computes the cohomology of `U`:

```text
H⁰(G, Coind_U^G A) ≅ H⁰(U, A),   H¹(G, Coind_U^G A) ≅ H¹(U, A),
H²(G, Coind_U^G A) ≅ H²(U, A).
```

All three isomorphisms are *evaluation at `1`* composed with restriction to `U`, so in degrees one
and two the forward map is the compatible-pair pullback `TauCeti.ContCohomology.explicitMap1`,
respectively `explicitMap2`, along the pair consisting of the inclusion `U ↪ G` and the counit
`TauCeti.DiscreteCoind.eval`; nothing about it
depends on a choice. The choice enters only in proving that this map is bijective, and what it uses
is a continuous section of `G → G ⧸ U`
(`TauCeti.exists_continuous_rightCosetFactorization`, Ribes-Zalesskii Prop. 2.2.2): writing
`g = w g * r g` with `w : G → U` continuous and `w (u * g) = u * w g`, a continuous `1`-cocycle
`c` of `U` is spread over `G` as

```text
(a g) x = c (w (x * g)) - c (w x),
```

which is `TauCeti.ContCohomology.coindCochain1`. This is a continuous `1`-cocycle of `G` with
values in `Coind_U^G A` whose Shapiro image is `c` up to the explicit coboundary `d⁰ (c (w 1))`
(`TauCeti.ContCohomology.shapiroCocycles1_coindCocycle1`), and conversely every continuous
`1`-cocycle `f` of `G` differs from the cochain rebuilt from its Shapiro image by an explicit
coboundary (`TauCeti.ContCohomology.sub_coindCochain1_mem_B1`). Those two identities make the
forward map bijective, and because the isomorphism is pinned by its forward direction the section
formula for the inverse (`TauCeti.ContCohomology.explicitShapiro1_symm_apply`) holds for *every*
such factorization, so there is no separate independence statement to prove.

Degree two is the same argument written in the homogeneous form of
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Homological/ContCohomology/Homogeneous.lean`, which is what makes it
manageable: `TauCeti.ContCohomology.coindCochain2` sends a continuous `2`-cocycle `c` of `U` to

```text
(a (g, h)) y = homogeneous2 c (w y) (w (y * g)) (w (y * g * h)),
```

the homogeneous form of `c` read at the three points `y`, `y g`, `y g h` of `G` pushed into `U` by
`w`. Its cocycle identity is the four-term homogeneous relation
`TauCeti.ContCohomology.homogeneous2_add_eq_add`, and the comparison of a cocycle with the cochain
rebuilt from its Shapiro image is the pointwise prism identity
`TauCeti.ContCohomology.homogeneous2_sub_comp` applied along `w`. Here the factorization is
required to be
**normalized**, `w 1 = 1`, which `TauCeti.exists_continuous_rightCosetFactorization` supplies: the
Shapiro image of the rebuilt cochain is then `c` on the nose
(`TauCeti.ContCohomology.shapiroCocycles2_coindCocycle2`), where a factorization with `w 1 = s`
would return the conjugate of `c` by `s` instead. Local constancy of both cochains in their group
arguments is uniform local constancy of the underlying function on the compact groups `G × G` and
`G × G × G` (`IsLocallyConstant.exists_isOpen_forall_mul_right_eq`).

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.constCoind` and `TauCeti.ContCohomology.explicitShapiro0`: the constant
  coinduced element at a `U`-invariant coefficient, and `H⁰(G, Coind_U^G A) ≃+ H⁰(U, A)`.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.shapiroCocycles1` and `TauCeti.ContCohomology.explicitShapiroMap1`: the
  forward Shapiro map on continuous `1`-cocycles and on `H¹`.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.shapiroLift`, `TauCeti.ContCohomology.coindCochain1` and
  `TauCeti.ContCohomology.coindCocycle1`: the inverse cochain built from a continuous right-coset
  factorization.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.explicitShapiro1`: `H¹(G, Coind_U^G A) ≃+ H¹(U, A)`.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.shapiroCocycles2` and `TauCeti.ContCohomology.explicitShapiroMap2`: the
  forward Shapiro map on continuous `2`-cocycles and on `H²`.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.coindCochain2` and `TauCeti.ContCohomology.coindCocycle2`: the inverse
  cochain in degree two, built from a normalized continuous right-coset factorization.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.explicitShapiro2`: `H²(G, Coind_U^G A) ≃+ H²(U, A)`.

## Implementation notes

Degree zero needs no topological hypothesis beyond a continuous multiplication on `G`: a
`G`-invariant element of the coinduced module is constant, and the constant it takes is
`U`-invariant. Degrees one and two are where profiniteness and closedness of `U` are used, through
the continuous factorization; for an *open* `U` the finite transversal `Quotient.out` would already
suffice, but openness is not assumed anywhere here.

/-- **Shapiro's lemma in degree two**, `H²(G, Coind_U^G A) ≅ H²(U, A)`, for a profinite `G` and a
closed subgroup `U`. The forward map is restriction to `U` followed by evaluation at `1`, and it
involves no choice; the continuous section of `G → G ⧸ U` is used only to prove it bijective. -/
