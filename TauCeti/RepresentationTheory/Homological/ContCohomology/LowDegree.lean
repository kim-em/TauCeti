# The explicit low-degree complex of continuous cochains

Continuous cochain cohomology of a topological group `G` acting on a topological module `M` is
computed in low degrees by an explicit complex of *plain functions carrying continuity as a
predicate*: `C¹` is the additive subgroup of continuous elements of `G → M` and `C²` the
subgroup of continuous elements of `G × G → M`. This file builds that complex, its differentials,
its cocycles and coboundaries, and the three low-degree cohomology groups

```text
H⁰(G, M) = M^G,   H¹(G, M) = Z¹/B¹,   H²(G, M) = Z²/B².
```

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.C1`, `TauCeti.ContCohomology.C2`: the continuous cochains.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.d0`, `d1`, `d2`: the inhomogeneous differentials, as additive
  homomorphisms of the ambient function groups.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.Z1`, `Z2`: the continuous cocycles, `Cⁱ ⊓ ker dⁱ`.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.B1`, `B2`: the coboundaries, `range d⁰` and the image `d¹(C¹)` of the
  *continuous* `1`-cochains.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.H0`, `H1`, `H2`, their class maps `H1pi`, `H2pi`, and the discrete
  carriers `DiscreteH1`, `DiscreteH2` used by the comparison with canonical cohomology, together
  with their identifications `discreteH1Equiv`, `discreteH2Equiv` with `H1` and `H2`.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.sumCocycle`: the additive map sending a finite-group `2`-cocycle to
  the invariant obtained by summing it over its first argument.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.explicitMap0`: the compatible-pair pullback on the explicit degree-zero
  carrier, with `TauCeti.ContCohomology.explicitRes0` and `explicitCoeff0` its two named
  instances.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.d1_comp_d0` and `TauCeti.ContCohomology.d2_comp_d1`: `d ∘ d = 0`.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.B1_le_Z1` and `TauCeti.ContCohomology.B2_le_Z2`: the form of `d ∘ d = 0`
  that the two quotients need, coboundaries being continuous.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.subsingleton_H1_of_subsingleton` and
  `subsingleton_H2_of_subsingleton`: a trivial group has vanishing `H¹` and `H²`.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.subsingleton_H1_of_subsingleton_coefficients` and
  `subsingleton_H2_of_subsingleton_coefficients`: a zero coefficient group has vanishing `H¹` and
  `H²`.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.nsmul_H1_eq_zero` and `nsmul_H2_eq_zero`: `H¹(G, M)` and `H²(G, M)`
  are killed by whatever kills the coefficients `M`.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.H1EquivOfSmulEqSelf`: for a trivial action, `H¹(G, M)` is the group of
  continuous homomorphisms `G →ₜ* Multiplicative M`. This is the statement that makes `H¹` of a
  profinite group computable, and it is false without continuity.

## Implementation notes

The differentials and the cocycle identities follow the conventions of Mathlib's
`Mathlib/RepresentationTheory/Homological/GroupCohomology/LowDegree.lean`:

```text
(d⁰ m) g       = g • m - m,
(d¹ f) (g, h)  = g • f h - f (g * h) + f g,
(d² f) (g, h, j) = g • f (h, j) - f (g * h, j) + f (g, h * j) - f (g, h).
```

The cocycle conditions are spelled by Mathlib's unbundled predicates
`groupCohomology.IsCocycle₁` and `groupCohomology.IsCocycle₂`, and
`TauCeti.ContCohomology.d1_apply_eq_zero_iff` and `d2_apply_eq_zero_iff` identify them with the
vanishing of the differentials, so that `Zⁱ = Cⁱ ⊓ ker dⁱ` — which is how `Z1` and `Z2` are
*defined*, taking their closure under the group operations from `AddMonoidHom.ker` — is stated in
that spelling by `mem_Z1_iff` and `mem_Z2_iff`.

Mathlib's bundled `groupCohomology.cocycles₁` and `cocycles₂` are *not* reused here: Mathlib's
low-degree group cohomology API states them for `Rep k G` with `k` and `G` in a single universe
(its binders are `{k G : Type u}`), and the coefficient modules of a profinite group have to be
allowed to live in the group's universe with a small coefficient ring such as `ℤ`. The unbundled
`IsCocycle₁`/`IsCocycle₂` predicates, which Mathlib provides for exactly this purpose, carry no
such constraint and are consumed directly. The cochain groups themselves are Mathlib's
`continuousAddSubgroup`.

The trivial-action results are the continuous analogues of Mathlib's
`groupCohomology.cocycles₁IsoOfIsTrivial`, `groupCohomology.coboundaries₁_eq_bot_of_isTrivial` and
`groupCohomology.H1IsoOfIsTrivial`, in the same order and with the same proof plan; they are
restated for the unbundled classes because the Mathlib versions are stated for `Rep k G`.

Cochains are not normalised. The identities at the unit, `f 1 = 0` in degree `1` and
`f (1, g) = f (1, 1)`, `f (g, 1) = g • f (1, 1)` in degree `2`, are the lemmas
`map_one_of_mem_Z1`, `map_one_fst_of_mem_Z2` and `map_one_snd_of_mem_Z2`, never definitional
conditions.

`H1` and `H2` divide `Z¹` and `Z²` by the coboundaries *viewed inside the cocycles*, in the
`AddSubgroup.addSubgroupOf` spelling, so that no proof term enters either quotient subgroup. Each
carrier retains the hypotheses of `TauCeti.ContCohomology.B1_le_Z1`, respectively
`B2_le_Z2`, through that inclusion theorem, so the subgroup divided out is always the whole of
`B¹`, respectively `B²`, and never the intersection `B ⊓ Z` that `addSubgroupOf` would cut out at a
weaker generality; `AddSubgroup.map_addSubgroupOf_eq_of_le` turns those inclusions into that
identity whenever a consumer needs it spelled out. The two carriers therefore sit in separate
sections:
`H¹` needs `G` to be a monoid acting continuously, and `H²` needs a continuous multiplication on
`G` besides, because `d¹` has to preserve continuity for `B² = d¹(C¹)` to consist of cocycles.

topology on `G → M`, and that topology is not the intended one: it need not be discrete. For

Continuity is what makes this useful rather than decorative: without it the right-hand side is the
group of abstract homomorphisms, which for a profinite group is enormous. -/
