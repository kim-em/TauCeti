# The explicit model against the canonical object, in degrees one and two

The explicit low-degree complex presents `H¹(G, M)` and `H²(G, M)` as `Z¹/B¹` and `Z²/B²`, honest
subquotients of the continuous functions on `G` and on `G × G`, while the canonical object is
Mathlib's `continuousCohomology n X` for `X` the image `TauCeti.ofDiscreteModule ℤ G M` of `M`
under the coefficient dictionary. This file identifies the two in degrees one and two.

The passage happens one level at a time. `CochainComparison.lean` identifies the inhomogeneous
cochains with the canonical homogeneous ones, and `CocycleComparison.lean` cuts that down to the
cocycles in degrees one and two. What remains, and is the content of this file, is the passage from
cocycles to classes: the
canonical homology is the cokernel of `HomologicalComplex.toCycles`, so a cocycle has trivial
canonical class exactly when it is a canonical boundary, and
`TauCeti.ContCohomology.mem_B1_iff_cocycleEquiv1_mem_range` together with its landed degree-two
counterpart says that those are precisely the explicit coboundaries.

The comparison is stated twice, and the two statements are not interchangeable. The additive
equivalence holds over an arbitrary topological group in degree one, and over a locally compact one
in degree two, the local compactness being what supplies `ContinuousMap.uncurry` for the degree-two
cochain comparison. The isomorphism in `TopModuleCat ℤ` needs `G` compact, and its source is the
**discrete** carrier `TauCeti.ContCohomology.DiscreteH1`, not the quotient topology that `H¹`
inherits from the pointwise topology on `G → M`: that inherited topology is not discrete in
general, so discreteness cannot be assumed, whereas the canonical side is discrete by
`TauCeti.discreteTopology_continuousCohomology`. A comparison stated in `TopModuleCat ℤ` against
the inherited topology would be false while its underlying additive statement stayed true, which
is why the discrete synonyms exist.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.explicitH1AddEquivContinuousCohomology` and
  `explicitH2AddEquivContinuousCohomology`: the comparisons as additive equivalences.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.explicitH1IsoContinuousCohomology` and
  `explicitH2IsoContinuousCohomology`: the comparisons as isomorphisms in `TopModuleCat ℤ`.
* `TopRep.explicitH1AddEquivContinuousCohomologyOfDiscrete` and
  `TopRep.explicitH2AddEquivContinuousCohomologyOfDiscrete`: the comparisons for the carrier of a
  discrete smooth representation over any scalars, obtained from the `ℤ`-comparisons by restricting
  scalars.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.explicitH1AddEquivContinuousCohomology_apply` and
  `explicitH2AddEquivContinuousCohomology_apply`: the comparisons send the class of an explicit
  cocycle to the homology class of the cocycle it corresponds to.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.explicitH1AddEquivContinuousCohomology_map` and
  `explicitH1AddEquivContinuousCohomology_coeffMap`: the degree-one comparison carries the
  explicit pullback along a compatible pair, and in particular the explicit coefficient map, to the
  canonical one; `TopRep.explicitH1AddEquivContinuousCohomologyOfDiscrete_map` is the same
  naturality for discrete representations over any scalars.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.explicitIso_map`: the same naturality in compatible pairs for the
  degree-one comparison in `TopModuleCat ℤ`, with `explicitIso_res` and `explicitIso_coeffMap` as
  its restriction and coefficient-map specializations.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.explicitH2AddEquivContinuousCohomology_map` and
  `explicitH2AddEquivContinuousCohomology_coeffMap`: the degree-two comparison carries the explicit
  pullback along a compatible pair, and in particular the explicit coefficient map, to the
  canonical one; `TopRep.explicitH2AddEquivContinuousCohomologyOfDiscrete_map` is the same
  naturality for discrete representations over any scalars.

/-! ### Discrete smooth representations over any scalars

The continuous cohomology of a discrete `X : TopRep k G` is that of its carrier `X.V` as a discrete
`ℤ`-module (`TauCeti.ContCohomology.ofDiscreteModuleRestrictScalarsIntEquiv`), so the
`ℤ`-comparisons above identify the explicit `H¹` and `H²` of `X.V` with `continuousCohomology 1 X`
and `continuousCohomology 2 X`. -/
