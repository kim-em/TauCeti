# The strict cohomological dimension exceeds the ordinary one by at most one

For a compact group `G` and a natural number `p`, the strict `p`-cohomological dimension is at
most one more than the ordinary one, `scd_p G ≤ cd_p G + 1` (NSW (3.3.3)). Together with
`TauCeti.cohomologicalDimensionAt_le_strictCohomologicalDimensionAt` this pins `scd_p G` to one
of the two values `cd_p G` and `cd_p G + 1`; both occur, `ℤ_p` having `cd_p = 1` and `scd_p = 2`.

The argument is Serre's. Suppose `Hⁱ(G, A) = 0` for every `i > n` and every discrete `p`-primary
torsion `G`-module `A`, and let `M` be an arbitrary discrete `G`-module. Multiplication by `p` on
`M` factors as `M ↠ pM ↪ M`, which gives two short exact sequences

```text
0 → M[p] → M → pM → 0,        0 → pM → M → M ⧸ pM → 0,
```

whose outer terms `M[p]` and `M ⧸ pM` are killed by `p`, hence `p`-primary torsion. For `i > n + 1`
the long exact sequences make `Hⁱ(G, M) → Hⁱ(G, pM)` injective, because `Hⁱ(G, M[p]) = 0`, and
`Hⁱ(G, pM) → Hⁱ(G, M)` injective, because `Hⁱ⁻¹(G, M ⧸ pM) = 0`. Their composite is multiplication
by `p` on `Hⁱ(G, M)`, which is therefore injective, so no nonzero class of `Hⁱ(G, M)` is killed by
a power of `p`: the `p`-primary component of `Hⁱ(G, M)` vanishes.

The long exact sequence of continuous cohomology is available for coefficients in the universe of
`G`, so the statements here fix the auxiliary universe parameter of the predicates of
`TauCeti.RepresentationTheory.Homological.ContCohomology.CohomologicalDimension.Basic` to that of
`G`, as in `TauCeti.cohomologicalDimensionLE_iff_forall_subsingleton_succ`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.CohomologicalDimensionLE.nsmul_right_injective`: under `CohomologicalDimensionLE p G n`,
  multiplication by `p` is injective on `Hⁱ(G, M)` for every `i > n + 1` and every discrete `M`.
* `TauCeti.CohomologicalDimensionLE.strictCohomologicalDimensionLE_add_one`:
  `CohomologicalDimensionLE p G n` implies `StrictCohomologicalDimensionLE p G (n + 1)`.
* `TauCeti.strictCohomologicalDimensionAt_le_cohomologicalDimensionAt_add_one`:
  `scd_p G ≤ cd_p G + 1` in `ℕ∞`, including the case `cd_p G = ⊤`.
* `TauCeti.StrictCohomologicalDimensionLE.primaryComponent_eq_bot_of_isSmoothDiscrete`: the strict
  vanishing predicate read on a smooth discrete object of `TopRep ℤ G`, such as the trivial
  module `ℤ`.
