# Acyclicity of `Coind_1^G A` in every degree

For a compact group `G` and a discrete module `A` over a topological ring `R`, the coinduced module
`Coind_1^G A = TauCeti.DiscreteCoind G ⊥ A` of the trivial subgroup, the locally constant maps
`G → A` under right translation, has vanishing continuous cohomology in every positive degree:

```text
Hⁿ⁺¹(G, Coind_1^G A) = 0,
```

for Mathlib's canonical `continuousCohomology`. This is the all-degree form of
`TauCeti.ContCohomology.subsingleton_H1_discreteCoind_bot` and
`TauCeti.ContCohomology.subsingleton_H2_discreteCoind_bot`, and it is the input to dimension
shifting in every degree.

The proof does not use Shapiro's lemma. Mathlib computes `Hⁿ(G, X)` as the homology of the
`G`-invariants of the shifted coinduced resolution `C(G, C(G, …, C(G, X)))`, whose differential
is defined recursively by `d (n + 1) F x = F - d n (F x)`. Two observations drive the argument.

* The full, non-invariant, coinduced resolution of *any* representation is contracted by
  evaluation at `1`: `d n (F 1) + (d (n + 1) F) 1 = F`, the single-point case of
  `TopRep.d_sum_apply_add_sum_d_apply` in
  `TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Homological/ContCohomology/Resolution.lean`. This is immediate
  from the recursion, but evaluation at `1` is not equivariant, so it does not act on the
  invariants.
* For the coefficients `X = Coind_1^G A`, an invariant element `F` of level `m` of the resolution
  is determined by *evaluation at `1` inside every level*, `x₁ ↦ ⋯ ↦ xₘ ↦ F x₁ ⋯ xₘ 1`, which lands
  in level `m` of the coinduced resolution of `A` with the trivial action (`evalLevel`). The
  inverse spreads a level `Φ` of that resolution back over `G`, as
  `x₁ ↦ ⋯ ↦ xₘ ↦ (y ↦ Φ (y x₁) ⋯ (y xₘ))` (`coindLevel`). Evaluation is a chain map
  (`evalLevel_d`), because the differential is natural in the underlying modules and does not see
  the action.

A cocycle `F` of degree `n + 1` is thus sent by evaluation to a cocycle `Φ` of the resolution of
`A`, which is `d (Φ 1)` by the contraction; spreading `Φ 1` back over `G` gives an invariant
cochain whose differential is the spread of `d (Φ 1) = Φ` (`d_coindLevel_const`), which is `F`.

Compactness of `G` enters in two places. Every level of the resolution is discrete
(`TauCeti.discreteTopology_resolutionX`), which makes `evalLevel` and `coindLevel` continuous, and
`G` is locally compact, which makes evaluation `C(G, Z) × G → Z` continuous and hence lets the
two-variable family `ContinuousMap.compSwapShearMulRight` be curried. Neither total
disconnectedness of `G` nor
any continuity of the action is needed. The coefficient ring `R` is arbitrary: evaluation at `1` is
`R`-linear, and nothing else in the argument depends on the scalars.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.evalLevel`: evaluation at `1` inside every level of the coinduced
  resolution of `Coind_1^G A`.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.coindLevel`: spreading a level of the resolution of `A` over `G`, built
  from the family `ContinuousMap.compSwapShearMulRight`, `x ↦ (y ↦ Ψ y (y * x))`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.evalLevel_d`: evaluation at `1` is a chain map.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.eq_coindLevel_const_evalLevel` and
  `TauCeti.ContCohomology.eq_of_evalLevel_eq`: an invariant element is recovered from, hence
  determined by, its evaluation at `1`.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.d_coindLevel_const`: spreading a constant family commutes with the
  differentials.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.subsingleton_continuousCohomology_discreteCoind_bot`:
  **`Hⁿ⁺¹(G, Coind_1^G A) = 0`** for every `n`, for a compact group `G` and a discrete `R`-module
  `A`; `TauCeti.ContCohomology.subsingleton_continuousCohomology_discreteCoind_bot_int` is its
  `R = ℤ` case for the integral module structure `AddCommGroup.toIntModule` on `Coind_1^G A`, the
  one Mathlib's instance search produces, and for an abelian group `A` without topology.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.coindAcyclic`: the same vanishing in the bundled language,
  `Hⁿ(G, Coind_1^G A)` is a zero object of `TopModuleCat R` for `n > 0` and a smooth discrete
  representation `A` of the trivial subgroup, with `Coind_1^G A = TauCeti.coindTopRep R G ⊥ A`.
