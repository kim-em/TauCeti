# Inflation and the inflation-restriction sequence

Inflation is the third named instance of the compatible-pair pullback on the explicit low-degree
complex: for a normal subgroup `N` of a topological group `G` it is the pullback along the
quotient homomorphism `G → G ⧸ N` paired with the inclusion `M ^ N ↪ M` of the invariants, which
is equivariant along that homomorphism. This file defines inflation in degrees `0`, `1`, and `2`.
In degree one it proves the exactness of

```text
0 → H¹(G ⧸ N, M ^ N) → H¹(G, M) → H¹(N, M)
```

at its two nodes. In degree two, when `H¹(N, M) = 0`, it proves that inflation is injective and,
for an open normal subgroup `N`, the exactness of

```text
0 → H²(G ⧸ N, M ^ N) → H²(G, M) → H²(N, M)
```

at `H²(G, M)`.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.explicitInfl0`, `explicitInfl1`, and `explicitInfl2`: inflation on the
  explicit model in degrees `0`, `1`, and `2`.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.explicitInfl0Equiv`: the additive equivalence between degree-zero
  cohomology before and after inflation.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.descendZ1` and `descendZ2`: descent of continuous cocycles to `G ⧸ N`.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.explicitInfl0_injective` and `explicitInfl0_surjective`: inflation in
  degree zero is bijective.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.explicitRes1_comp_explicitInfl1` and
  `TauCeti.ContCohomology.explicitRes2_comp_explicitInfl2`: restricting an inflated class back to
  `N` gives zero.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.explicitInfl0_eq_explicitMap0`, `explicitInfl1_eq_explicitMap1` and
  `explicitInfl2_eq_explicitMap2`: inflation in degrees `0`, `1` and `2` is the compatible-pair
  pullback along `G → G ⧸ N`.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.explicitInfl1_injective`: inflation is injective in degree `1`.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.explicitInfRes_exact`: the image of inflation is exactly the kernel of
  restriction in degree `1`.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.explicitInfl2_injective`: inflation is injective in degree `2` when
  `H¹(N, M) = 0`, for coefficients of any topology.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.explicitInfRes2_exact`: for an open normal subgroup `N` with
  `H¹(N, M) = 0`, the image of inflation is exactly the kernel of restriction in degree `2`.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.coe_descendZ1_apply_mk` and `coe_descendZ2_apply_mk`: the descents agree
  with the original cocycles on quotient representatives.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.explicitInfl1_descendZ1` and `explicitInfl2_descendZ2`: inflating the
  descended cocycles returns their original classes.

## Implementation notes

Inflation lives here rather than beside `explicitRes1` and `explicitCoeff1` in
`ExplicitFunctoriality.lean` because it is the one of the three named instances whose coefficients
change — it needs the invariants and their quotient action — and because the exactness statements
below are about that same map and belong with it.

The coefficients over the quotient group are Mathlib's `FixedPoints.addSubgroup N M`, with the
`G ⧸ N`-action and the coercion lemmas supplied by
`TauCeti/GroupTheory/GroupAction/FixedPoints.lean`; no second name for `M ^ N` is introduced.
Continuity of that action is carried as the instance hypothesis
`[ContinuousSMul (G ⧸ N) (FixedPoints.addSubgroup N M)]` rather than deduced from discreteness of
`M`, because nothing below uses discreteness for anything else;
`TauCeti.continuousSMulQuotientFixedPointsOfContinuousSMul` discharges it for a discrete `M`, which
is the case arising in arithmetic applications.

Everything here except `TauCeti.ContCohomology.explicitInfRes2_exact` holds for an arbitrary
topological group `G` and an arbitrary normal subgroup `N`; neither profiniteness nor closedness of
`N` is used. Closedness would only make `G ⧸ N` Hausdorff, and the descent argument in
`TauCeti.ContCohomology.explicitInfRes_exact` needs nothing but the quotient topology: a cochain
on `G` that is constant on the cosets of `N` descends to a *continuous* cochain on `G ⧸ N`
precisely because `G ⧸ N` carries that topology.

The exactness proof is the classical cochain argument. After subtracting the coboundary that
trivialises a cocycle on `N`, the corrected cocycle vanishes on `N`, hence is constant on the
cosets of `N` and takes its values in `M ^ N`, so it is the inflation of a continuous `1`-cocycle
on `G ⧸ N`. This is the continuous counterpart of Mathlib's discrete `groupCohomology.H1InfRes`
and `groupCohomology.H1InfRes_exact`, which are stated for `Rep k G` and so are unavailable at the
universe-polymorphic unbundled generality used here.

In degree two, exactness at `H²(G, M)` says that a class whose restriction to `N` vanishes is
inflated from `H²(G ⧸ N, M ^ N)`. The hypothesis `H¹(N, M) = 0` is needed: without it, the kernel
of restriction can be strictly larger than the image of inflation. The proof on cochains replaces
a cocycle killed by restriction with a cohomologous one vanishing on `G × N` and on `N × G`, which
then descends to `G ⧸ N` (`TauCeti.ContCohomology.descendZ2`). The cohomologous cocycle is built
from a choice of coset representatives of `N`; openness of `N` makes `G ⧸ N` discrete, so that
this choice, and hence the correction, is continuous. Injectivity in degree two needs no openness:
if an inflated cocycle is the coboundary of `c`, the vanishing of `H¹(N, M)` corrects `c` by a
coboundary to a cochain constant on the cosets of `N` with `N`-fixed values, which descends. For
discrete `M` the weaker hypothesis that the `G`-invariant part of `H¹(N, M)` vanishes suffices,
through the five-term sequence (`TauCeti.ContCohomology.explicitInfl2_injective_of_subsingleton`).
