# Transport along equalities of degrees in the homogeneous cochain complex

Mathlib's `HomologicalComplex.XIsoOfEq` transports an element of a complex along an equality of
degrees. For the coinduced resolution `TopRep.resolution X` of a topological representation and
for its complex of homogeneous cochains `TopRep.homogeneousCochains X`, this file records how such
a transport is read: evaluating a transported element of the resolution at a point of the group is
the transported value one degree down, and the transport of a homogeneous cochain is, on the
underlying element of the resolution, the transport one degree up. Both rules are used wherever
two constructions land in degrees that are equal but not definitionally so, as for the total
degree `m + n` of a cup product built by recursion on `m`. On continuous cohomology the transport
is `degreeCast`, the isomorphism `continuousCohomology n X ≅ continuousCohomology k X` along an
equality `n = k`, and a cocycle that is the transport of another has the transported class
(`π_eq_degreeCast_π`).

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.ContinuousCohomology.degreeCast`: transport of continuous cohomology along an equality
  of degrees.
* `TauCeti.ContinuousCohomology.cocyclesDegreeCast`: transport of cocycles along an equality of
  degrees.
