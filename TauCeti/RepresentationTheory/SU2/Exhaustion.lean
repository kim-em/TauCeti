# The symmetric powers exhaust the irreducibles of `SU(2)`

`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/SU2/Irreducible.lean` shows the symmetric powers `Symᵈ(ℂ²)` of the
standard representation of `SU(2)` are irreducible and pairwise inequivalent, and
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/SU2/Completeness.lean` shows their characters span a uniformly dense
subspace of the continuous class functions. This file closes the classification: **every**
finite-dimensional irreducible continuous representation of `SU(2)` is one of them
(`TauCeti.SU2.exists_nonempty_equiv_symPower`), and the degree is unique
(`TauCeti.SU2.existsUnique_nonempty_equiv_symPower`), so `d ↦ Symᵈ(ℂ²)` is a bijection from `ℕ`
onto the isomorphism classes.

The deduction is the classical one: an irreducible not in the list has a character orthogonal to
every `χ_d`, hence -- by continuity of the `L²` pairing along the uniform approximation -- to
every class function, hence to itself, contradicting `‖χ_π‖ = 1`. What is new here is the
plumbing that lets the general orthogonality relations of
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Compact/Character/Basic.lean` reach `Symᵈ(ℂ²)` at all: those
relations are about a `ContRepresentation` on a *normed* space, whereas `Symᵈ(ℂ²)` is a symmetric
tensor power, carrying no topology. So the weight basis is used to carry the symmetric power onto
the standard model `ℂ^{d+1}` (`TauCeti.SU2.symPowerModel`), and its action is shown to be
continuous.

That continuity is the one genuinely analytic step. A group element acts on a pure symmetric
tensor factor by factor, so the action is the composition of the continuous map
`g ↦ (g·v₁, …, g·v_d)` with the multilinear map `⨂ₛ`, read in coordinates; multilinear maps on
finite-dimensional spaces are continuous
(`MultilinearMap.continuous_of_finiteDimensional`), and expanding an arbitrary vector in
the weight basis extends the conclusion from pure tensors to all of `Symᵈ(ℂ²)`.

Unitarity of `Symᵈ(ℂ²)` is *not* established, and is not needed: the second orthogonality
relation asks for unitarity only of the representation being tested, and even that hypothesis is
discharged by Weyl's unitarian trick, so the statements below assume none. The transported model
carries the inner product making the weight basis orthonormal, which for `d ≥ 2` is not the
`SU(2)`-invariant one.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.SU2.symPowerModel`: `Symᵈ(ℂ²)` as a continuous representation on `ℂ^{d+1}`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.SU2.exists_nonempty_equiv_symPower`: every finite-dimensional irreducible continuous
  representation of `SU(2)` is equivalent to some `Symᵈ(ℂ²)`.
* `TauCeti.SU2.existsUnique_nonempty_equiv_symPower`: the degree `d` is unique.

## References

The character-theoretic argument uses the irreducibility and weight results of
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/SU2/Irreducible.lean` together with the density of the character
span. It is not circular. Peter-Weyl is nowhere used;
the density is Stone-Weierstrass applied to the Chebyshev recursion for `χ_d`; and the
orthogonality relations invoked are the general compact-group ones of
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Compact/Character/Basic.lean`, which know nothing of `SU(2)`, rather
than the concrete `SU(2)` orthonormality that is computed from the Weyl integration formula.

/-- The inner-product case of `TauCeti.SU2.exists_nonempty_equiv_symPower`, where the characters
live; the general normed case is reduced to it by transport to a Euclidean model.

Suppose not. Then `π` is inequivalent to every `Symᵈ(ℂ²)`, so by Schur's lemma there is no nonzero
intertwiner between them, and the second character orthogonality relation makes the character of
`π` orthogonal in `L²(SU(2))` to every `χ_d`. Pairing with the character of `π` is a *continuous*
functional on `C(SU(2), ℂ)`, so it then kills the whole uniform closure of the span of the `χ_d`,
which by `TauCeti.SU2.mem_topologicalClosure_characterSpan_iff` is all of the continuous class
functions. But the character of `π` is itself a class function, and pairs with itself to `1` by
the first orthogonality relation.

Unitarity is not assumed: Weyl's unitarian trick
(`ContRepresentation.exists_isUnitary_congr`) makes any such representation unitary after
conjugating by an automorphism of the carrier, and the conjugation is an equivalence, so it
changes neither the hypotheses nor the conclusion. -/

Neither an inner product nor unitarity is assumed of the carrier. A finite-dimensional normed
space over `ℂ` is continuously linearly equivalent to `ℂ^{dim V}` by dimension count, and
transporting `π` along that equivalence changes neither the hypotheses nor the conclusion, so the
argument may be run on a Euclidean carrier, where the characters live; there Weyl's unitarian
trick disposes of unitarity in the same way. -/
