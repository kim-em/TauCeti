# The weight decomposition of `Symᵈ(ℂ²)` under the maximal torus of `SU(2)`

`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/SU2/SymmetricPower.lean` computes the *character* of the symmetric
power `Symᵈ(ℂ²)` of the standard representation of `SU(2)` on the maximal torus as the weight
string `z^{-d} + z^{2-d} + ⋯ + z^d`.  A character is a trace, so it records the weights only with
multiplicity; this file builds the decomposition behind it.

The monomial basis of `Symᵈ(ℂ²)`, reindexed by `Fin (d + 1)` through
`TauCeti.symFinTwoEquiv`, is a basis of **weight vectors**: `diag(z, z⁻¹)` acts on the `i`-th one
by the scalar `z^{2i - d}`.  The `d + 1` weights `2i - d` are pairwise distinct, so each weight
occurs with multiplicity exactly one, and the character above,
`TauCeti.SU2.character_symPower_torusHom_zpow`, is their sum.

Two consequences make this the form the highest-weight classification uses.

* **A torus-stable subspace is spanned by weight vectors.**  Nothing forces this for a single
  operator with repeated eigenvalues; here the eigenvalues are distinct, which is exactly the
  hypothesis of the general coordinate argument
  `TauCeti/LinearAlgebra/Eigenspace/DiagonalBasis.lean`.  Feeding it a torus element whose
  integer powers are pairwise distinct — `exp(i)`, by the irrationality of `π` — separates the
  `d + 1` weights at once.  That element is a device of the proof and stays private to this file.
* **The weight spaces are lines.**  A nonzero vector on which the whole torus acts through a
  single character `z ↦ z^m` is a multiple of one basis vector, and `m` is one of the `d + 1`
  weights.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.SU2.weightBasis`: the weight basis of `Symᵈ(ℂ²)`, indexed by `Fin (d + 1)`.
* `TauCeti.SU2.weight`: the weight `2i - d` of the `i`-th weight vector.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.SU2.symPower_torusHom_weightBasis`: `diag(z, z⁻¹)` acts on the `i`-th weight vector by
  `z^{2i - d}`, and `TauCeti.SU2.weight_injective`: the weights are pairwise distinct.
* `TauCeti.SU2.weightBasis_mem_of_repr_ne_zero` and `TauCeti.SU2.eq_span_weightBasis_mem`: a
  torus-stable subspace contains every weight vector occurring in one of its elements, and is
  spanned by the weight vectors it contains.
* `TauCeti.SU2.exists_weight_eq_of_forall_torusHom_smul`: a nonzero vector on which the torus acts
  through a single character `z ↦ z^m` is a multiple of a single weight vector, and `m` is that
  vector's weight.

`TauCetiRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/CompactGroups/README.md`, which asks for the weights
`{d, d-2, …, -d}` of `Symᵈ(ℂ²)` "each with multiplicity one, computed from the diagonal action",
as the input to the highest-weight argument.

/-- **The weight basis of `Symᵈ(ℂ²)`**: the monomial basis of the symmetric power, whose index
`i : Fin (d + 1)` counts the factors equal to the first standard basis vector of `ℂ²`.  Its
elements are eigenvectors of the maximal torus, by
`TauCeti.SU2.symPower_torusHom_weightBasis`. -/

`-d, 2 - d, …, d - 2, d`. -/

/-- **The maximal torus is diagonal in the weight basis**: `diag(z, z⁻¹)` multiplies the `i`-th

/-! ### A torus element with pairwise distinct powers -/

/-- **A generic element of the maximal torus**: `exp(i)`, an element of infinite order.  Its
integer powers are pairwise distinct (`coe_genericTorus_zpow_injective`) because `π` is
irrational, so it already separates the `d + 1` weights of `Symᵈ(ℂ²)` for every `d` at once.

This is the separating element the proofs below run on, not part of the interface: the results
they prove are stated for the whole torus. -/
private noncomputable def genericTorus : Circle := Circle.exp 1

/-- **The powers of `genericTorus` are pairwise distinct.**  An equality
`exp(i)^m = exp(i)^n` says `m - n` is an integer multiple of `2π`, which forces `m = n` since `π`
is irrational. -/

variable {d}

/-- **A torus-stable subspace contains every weight vector that occurs in one of its elements.**
The torus is diagonal in the weight basis and the weights `weight d i` are pairwise distinct, so
a single torus element already separates the coordinates of a vector. -/

vector, and `m` is that vector's weight, one of the `d + 1` integers `2i - d`. -/
