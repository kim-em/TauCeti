# Characters of `SU(2)` are even on the maximal torus

The Weyl group of `SU(2)` computed in `TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/SU2/Weyl/Basic.lean` inverts the
maximal torus: the quarter turn `w = !![0, -1; 1, 0]` conjugates `diag (z, z⁻¹)` to
`diag (z⁻¹, z)`. Characters are conjugation invariant, so the character of a continuous
finite-dimensional representation of `SU(2)` takes the same value at a torus element and at its
inverse. In the angle parametrisation `θ ↦ diag (e^{iθ}, e^{-iθ})` this reads
`χ (torusExp (-θ)) = χ (torusExp θ)`: the character is an even function of `θ`.

This is the `W`-invariance, on the maximal torus, of the characters of `SU(2)`, and it is what
makes those characters functions of `cos θ`. Off the torus this is subsumed by the classification
of the conjugacy classes of `SU(2)` by the trace: a character, being a class function, is a
function of the trace on all of `SU(2)` (`ContRepresentation.character_eq_of_trace_eq`).

## Main results

* `ContRepresentation.character_torusHom_inv`: the character of a continuous finite-dimensional
  representation of `SU(2)` agrees at `diag (z, z⁻¹)` and `diag (z⁻¹, z)`.
* `ContRepresentation.character_torusExp_neg`: read in the angle parametrisation of the maximal
  torus,
  that character is an even function of the angle.
* `ContRepresentation.character_eq_of_trace_eq`: that character is a function of the trace.

/-- The character of a continuous representation of `SU(2)`, read in the angle parametrisation

which the characters of `SU(2)` are `W`-invariant functions on the torus. -/

/-- **The character of a continuous finite-dimensional representation of `SU(2)` is a function of
the trace**, the trace being a complete conjugacy invariant
(`TauCeti.SU2.isConj_iff_trace_eq`). Combined with
`TauCeti.SU2.exists_isConj_torusExp_mem_Icc` this is what lets a character of `SU(2)` be computed
from its values `θ ↦ χ (diag (e^{iθ}, e^{-iθ}))` on the Weyl chamber `[0, π]` alone. -/
