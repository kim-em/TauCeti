# Orthonormality of the `SU(2)` characters over the Weyl chamber

`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/SU2/Weyl/Character.lean` computes the character of the symmetric
power `Symᵈ(ℂ²)` on the maximal torus in the angle parametrisation:
`sin θ · χ_d (diag (e^{iθ}, e^{-iθ})) = sin ((d+1) θ)`, with no hypothesis on `θ`.

This file integrates the resulting products against the `SU(2)` **Weyl density**. Writing a class
function on `SU(2)` as a function of the angle `θ` on the Weyl chamber `[0, π]`, the Weyl
integration formula transports the Haar probability measure to the density
`(2π)⁻¹ · 4 sin²θ dθ`, whose Weyl factor `4 sin²θ = |e^{iθ} - e^{-iθ}|²` is the squared modulus of
the Weyl denominator. Against that density the characters of the symmetric powers are
**orthonormal**:

`(2π)⁻¹ ∫₀^π χ_m · conj χ_n · 4 sin²θ dθ = δ_{mn}`.

The computation is short once the Weyl numerator identity is in hand: the two factors of `sin θ`
in the density are absorbed by the two characters, turning the integrand into
`4 sin ((m+1) θ) sin ((n+1) θ)`, and the identity becomes the orthogonality of the sine system on
`[0, π]` (`TauCeti.two_div_pi_mul_integral_sin_succ_mul_sin_succ`). No case distinction at the
zeros of `sin` is needed, because the numerator identity holds there too.

Two things are deliberately *not* proved here. First, the Weyl integration formula itself -- that
integrating a class function over `SU(2)` against Haar equals the right-hand side above -- is a
measure-theoretic statement about `SU(2)`; it is `TauCeti.SU2.weyl_integration_formula` in
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/SU2/Weyl/Integration.lean`, which combines it with the results below
into the orthonormality of the characters against Haar measure. Second, that the `Symᵈ(ℂ²)`
exhaust the irreducible representations of `SU(2)`: that is the separate highest-weight
classification, and character orthonormality is validation for it, not a substitute.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.SU2.character_symPower_mul_conj_mul_four_mul_sin_sq`: the pointwise absorption
  `χ_m · conj χ_n · 4 sin²θ = 4 · (sin ((m+1) θ) · sin ((n+1) θ))`, valid at every angle.
* `TauCeti.SU2.character_symPower_orthonormal_torusExp`: **the orthonormality relation**
  `(2π)⁻¹ ∫₀^π χ_m · conj χ_n · 4 sin²θ dθ = δ_{mn}`.
* `TauCeti.SU2.weyl_integration_formula_normalized`: the total mass of the Weyl density is `1`,
  the normalization test `(2π)⁻¹ ∫₀^π 4 sin²θ dθ = 1`. This is the degree `m = n = 0` case of the
  orthonormality relation, and is derived from it.

The realness of the character on the torus, which makes the conjugation in the integrand
harmless, is `TauCeti.SU2.conj_character_symPower_torusExp`, proved with the closed forms in
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/SU2/Weyl/Character.lean`.

## References

Character orthonormality through the Weyl integration formula reduces to
`(2/π) ∫₀^π sin ((m+1) θ) sin ((n+1) θ) dθ = δ_{mn}`.

/-- **The Weyl factor absorbs the two characters.** The factor `4 sin²θ = |e^{iθ} - e^{-iθ}|²` of
the Weyl density supplies one `sin θ` to each character, and each is turned into a Weyl numerator
by `TauCeti.SU2.sin_mul_character_symPower_torusExp`:

`χ_m (diag (e^{iθ}, e^{-iθ})) · conj χ_n (diag (e^{iθ}, e^{-iθ})) · 4 sin²θ
  = 4 · (sin ((m+1) θ) · sin ((n+1) θ))`.

No hypothesis on `θ` is needed, in particular none at the zeros of `sin`, because the numerator
identity itself needs none. -/

/-- **Orthonormality of the `SU(2)` characters over the Weyl chamber.** Against the Weyl density
`(2π)⁻¹ · 4 sin²θ dθ` on `[0, π]`, the characters of the symmetric powers `Symᵈ(ℂ²)` of the
standard representation are orthonormal:

`(2π)⁻¹ ∫₀^π χ_m · conj χ_n · 4 sin²θ dθ = δ_{mn}`.

The name records that this is orthonormality of the characters *restricted to the torus*, against
the transported density, not against Haar measure on `SU(2)`. Composing it with the Weyl
integration formula `TauCeti.SU2.weyl_integration_formula` -- which reduces the Haar integral of a
class function on `SU(2)` to exactly this right-hand side -- gives the character orthonormality
`∫ χ_m · conj χ_n dμ = δ_{mn}`
(`TauCeti.SU2.integral_character_symPower_mul_conj`), in the shape of the abstract
`ContRepresentation.character_orthonormal_self` and
`ContRepresentation.character_orthonormal_distinct`
(`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Compact/Character/Basic.lean`), whose name shape this deliberately
does *not* reuse. -/

/-- **The Weyl density has total mass `1`.** This is the `f = 1` normalization test for the Weyl
integration formula of `SU(2)`: the transported torus density `(2π)⁻¹ · 4 sin²θ` on the Weyl
chamber `[0, π]` integrates to `1`, as it must if it is to represent the Haar *probability*
measure.

It is the degree `m = n = 0` case of `TauCeti.SU2.character_symPower_orthonormal_torusExp`, since
`Sym⁰(ℂ²)` is the trivial representation and its character is `1`, and is proved that way. -/
