# Induction is a homomorphism of modules over the representation ring

For a finite-index subgroup `S ≤ G` over a field `k`, inducing a finite-dimensional representation
is the functor `TauCeti.indFDRepFunctor : FDRep k S ⥤ FDRep k G`. This file passes that functor to
the representation rings of `TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/RepresentationRing/Basic.lean`:

`TauCeti.repRingInd k S : R(S) →+ R(G)`.

It is a homomorphism of **additive groups** only, and unavoidably so: induction does not preserve
the tensor product, and it does not send the trivial representation of `S` to the trivial
representation of `G` -- it sends it to the permutation representation on `G ⧸ S`, of dimension
`S.index`. The structure it *does* carry is one level down. Restriction makes `R(S)` an
`R(G)`-algebra (`TauCeti.repRingRes`), and with respect to that structure induction is
`R(G)`-linear:

`Ind (x · Res y) = (Ind x) · y`,

which is `TauCeti.repRingInd_mul_repRingRes`. This is Frobenius reciprocity in its module form, and
it is the projection formula `TauCeti.indFDRepProjection` of
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Induction/FiniteDimensional/Projection.lean` read on isomorphism
classes: the representation-level isomorphism `Ind_S^G (A ⊗ Res_S^G B) ≅ (Ind_S^G A) ⊗ B` becomes
an identity of classes, and both sides of the displayed equation are additive in each variable, so
the two classes generate the general case. Its immediate consequence is that the image of induction
is an **ideal** of `R(G)`, `TauCeti.repRingIndIdeal` -- the object the Artin and Brauer induction
theorems are statements about.

On characters everything is as expected: the character of an induced virtual representation is the
induced class function of its character (`TauCeti.repRingCharacter_repRingInd`), so the square
formed by the two character homomorphisms, induction on `R(S)` and `Subgroup.indClassFun` commutes.

## Implementation notes

`TauCeti.repRingInd` and `TauCeti.repRingCharacter_repRingInd` leave the field and the group in
independent universes, exactly as `TauCeti.repRingRes` does. `TauCeti.repRingInd_mul_repRingRes`
and `TauCeti.repRingIndIdeal` do not: both are stated with `G` in the universe of `k`. That is a
restriction of the current proof route rather than of the statements — it is inherited from
`TauCeti.indFDRepProjection`, which is built from the `Rep`-level `TauCeti.indProjection`, and the
same caveat is recorded there.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.repRingInd`: induction from a finite-index subgroup, as an additive homomorphism of
  representation rings.
* `TauCeti.repRingIndIdeal`: its image, as an ideal of the representation ring of the ambient
  group, for `G` in the universe of `k`.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.repRingInd_of`: induction sends the class of a representation to the class of the
  induced representation.
* `TauCeti.repRingInd_mul_repRingRes`: **the projection formula on the representation ring**,
  `Ind (x · Res y) = (Ind x) · y`; induction is a homomorphism of `R(G)`-modules.
* `TauCeti.repRingCharacter_repRingInd`: the character of an induced virtual representation is the
  induced class function of its character.
* `TauCeti.mem_repRingIndIdeal_iff`: membership in that ideal is being induced.
