# The characters of the two squares of a continuous representation

The symmetric square and the exterior square of a representation have characters
`χ_{Sym²}` and `χ_{Λ²}`; away from characteristic two they are determined by the character of the
representation through `χ_{Sym²}(g) = ½(χ(g)² + χ(g²))` and `χ_{Λ²}(g) = ½(χ(g)² - χ(g²))`
(`Representation.char_symmetricSquare` and `Representation.char_exteriorSquare` of
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Tensor/Square.lean`). For a representation with continuous
operator-valued action those closed formulas exhibit both square characters as continuous functions
of `g`, which is what the first section records.

Neither continuity statement needs the symmetric or exterior square to be assembled as a
*continuous* representation: the closed formulas are used as they stand, so only the continuity of
`χ` and of `g ↦ χ(g * g)` (`ContRepresentation.continuous_character_mul_self`) enters.

The second section reads the *difference* of the two square characters on the squares that
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Continuous/Square/Basic.lean` does assemble as continuous
representations, the eigenspaces of the flip inside `V ⊗[𝕜] V`: there
`χ_{Sym²}(g) - χ_{Λ²}(g) = χ(g²)`, which is the linear-algebra identity
`LinearMap.trace_symmetricTensorsRestrict_sub_trace_antisymmetricTensorsRestrict` applied to `π g`.
Subtracting the two closed formulas above gives the same identity on the powers, so the two
sections agree wherever both apply.

## Main statements

* `ContRepresentation.continuous_character_symmetricPower_two` and
  `ContRepresentation.continuous_character_exteriorPower_two`: the two square characters of a
  continuous representation are continuous.
* `ContRepresentation.character_symmetricSquare_sub_character_exteriorSquare`: the characters of
  the symmetric and the exterior square differ by the character at the square,
  `χ_{Sym²}(g) - χ_{Λ²}(g) = χ(g²)`.

## Implementation notes

Nothing here needs a group, a measure, or compactness, so the statements are made over a
topological monoid; the consumers are
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Compact/FrobeniusSchur/Basic.lean`, where continuity supplies the
integrability of the two square characters against Haar measure, and
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Compact/FrobeniusSchur/InvariantTensors.lean`, where the pointwise
identity is integrated against it.

The two sections ask different things of the scalars. For the continuity statements they are a
complete nontrivially normed field `𝕜` with `2 ≠ 0` — exactly what the trace functional behind
`ContRepresentation.character` and the closed formulas ask for; the consumer instantiates
them at `ℂ`. There `𝕜` is in `Type` rather than `Type*` because the symmetric- and exterior-power
representations of `TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/SymmetricPower.lean` and
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/ExteriorPower.lean`, whose characters are spoken of, are built over a
base ring in `Type`, so a field in an arbitrary universe would not even let the statements be
formed. The hypothesis `2 ≠ 0` is explicit rather than a `CharZero`-style instance because that is
the shape `Representation.char_symmetricSquare` and `Representation.char_exteriorSquare` carry. The
pointwise identity instead needs the two squares of
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Continuous/Square/Basic.lean`, whose carriers are submodules of an
inner product space, so its scalars are `RCLike 𝕜`, in any universe, and `2` is invertible there by
instance.

All declarations sit in the root `ContRepresentation` namespace, so that
`π.continuous_character_symmetricPower_two hπ` elaborates. The ambient `TauCeti` constructions
this file consumes are brought in by `open`.
