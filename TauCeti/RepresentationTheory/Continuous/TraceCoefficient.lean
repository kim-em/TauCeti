# The trace coefficient of an operator against a continuous representation

A finite-dimensional continuous representation `π` of `G` on `V` pairs an operator
`T : V →L[𝕜] V` with the function

`traceCoeff π hπ T : x ↦ trace (T ∘ π x⁻¹)`,

its **trace coefficient**. The pairing is linear in `T`, lands in `C(G, 𝕜)`, and sends the rank-one
operator `rankOne 𝕜 w v` to the matrix coefficient `x ↦ ⟪π x v, w⟫` of
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Continuous/MatrixCoefficient.lean` when `π` is unitary
(`ContRepresentation.traceCoeff_rankOne`). An operator is the sum of the rank-one operators built
from an orthonormal basis and its own values on that basis, so a trace coefficient is a sum of
`dim V` matrix coefficients (`ContRepresentation.traceCoeff_eq_sum`) and the two pairings span the
same functions; what the operator form adds is that the *whole* space of operators is the parameter
space, with no choice of basis and no sesquilinearity to track.

The reason to name it is the two-sided symmetry. The operators carry the `G × G`-action
`(g, h) • T = π g ∘ T ∘ π h⁻¹` of `ContRepresentation.biLinHom π π`, built in
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Continuous/LinHom.lean`. Under the trace coefficient that action
becomes **bi-translation** of functions,

`traceCoeff π hπ ((g, h) • T) x = traceCoeff π hπ T (g⁻¹ * x * h)`

(`ContRepresentation.traceCoeff_biLinHom_apply`): the cyclicity of the trace moves `π g` from the
left of `T` to the right of it, where it meets `π h⁻¹ ∘ π x⁻¹`. No inner product is needed for that,
only the group law; so the trace coefficient and its bi-translation identities are stated for a
finite-dimensional normed space over a complete nontrivially normed field, and the inner product
enters only in the comparison with the matrix coefficients. Composed with `ContinuousMap.toLp`
this is the equivariance of the Peter-Weyl block of a compact group, in
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Compact/TraceCoefficient/Basic.lean`.

## Main definitions

* `ContRepresentation.traceCoeff`: the trace coefficient `T ↦ (x ↦ trace (T ∘ π x⁻¹))`, as a linear
  map into `C(G, 𝕜)`.

## Main statements

* `ContRepresentation.traceCoeff_rankOne`: the trace coefficient of a rank-one operator is a matrix
  coefficient, for a unitary representation.
* `ContRepresentation.traceCoeff_eq_sum`: a trace coefficient expands over an orthonormal basis as
  a sum of matrix coefficients.
* `ContRepresentation.traceCoeff_biLinHom_apply` and
  `ContRepresentation.traceCoeff_biLinHom`: **the two-sided Hom action becomes bi-translation of
  the trace coefficient.**
* `ContRepresentation.traceCoeff_one`: the trace coefficient of the identity operator is the
  character, read at the inverse.

`(g, h) • T = π g ∘ T ∘ π h⁻¹` with `π` gives the function `x ↦ traceCoeff π hπ T (g⁻¹ * x * h)`.

The trace is cyclic, so `π g` passes from the left of `T` to its right, where the three remaining
factors multiply to `π ((g⁻¹ * x * h)⁻¹)`. Nothing is assumed beyond the group law; in particular
no unitarity. -/
