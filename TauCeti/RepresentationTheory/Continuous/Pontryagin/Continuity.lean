# Continuity of the integrated-character parameter

Let `π` be a strongly continuous unitary representation of an abelian topological group equipped
with a regular invariant measure, and let `A` be a complete star subalgebra containing all
integrated operators.
A character of `A` that is nonzero on some integrated operator determines a continuous group
character by `ContRepresentation.existsUnique_pontryaginDual_of_integratedOperatorL1`.

This file packages the characters on which that construction is defined and proves that the
resulting map to the Pontryagin dual is continuous.  Near a character `ω`, choose an integrated
operator `π(f)` on which `ω` is nonzero.  The detected group character then has the local formula

`χ(g) = ω(π(g)π(f)) / ω(π(f))`.

The numerator is jointly continuous in `ω` and `g`: norm continuity of translated integrated
operators combines with weak-* continuity of evaluation and the uniform norm bound on characters
of a Banach algebra.  The denominator remains nonzero in a neighbourhood of `ω`, so the displayed
quotient proves the required local continuity.  This continuity is the input needed to push a
character-space spectral measure to the Pontryagin dual.

## Main declarations

* `ContRepresentation.integratedCharacterSet`: algebra characters that do not annihilate every
  integrated operator.
* `ContRepresentation.integratedCharacterToPontryaginDual`: the group character detected by an
  integrated-algebra character.
* `ContRepresentation.continuous_integratedCharacterToPontryaginDual`: continuity of this
  assignment.

* The local-quotient continuity proof generalizes Tau Ceti's earlier formalization in
  `TauCeti.StronglyContinuousSpectral.continuousOn_dual`
  (`TauCeti.Analysis.Fourier.Pontryagin.StronglyContinuous`), which was stated for the
  integrated algebra of a unitary representation with respect to a Haar measure.
