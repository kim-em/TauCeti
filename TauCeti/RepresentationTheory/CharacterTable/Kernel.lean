# The kernel of a complex character

A representation `ρ` of a group has a kernel, the subgroup `ρ.ker` of the elements acting as the
identity, and it is normal because it is the kernel of a homomorphism. The character sees that
kernel: for a finite-dimensional complex representation and an element `g` of **finite order**,

`g ∈ ρ.ker ↔ ρ.character g = ρ.character 1`,

so the kernel is read off the character alone. That equivalence is the content of this file
(`Representation.mem_ker_iff_char_eq` and its `FDRep` form `FDRep.mem_ker_iff_char_eq`), together
with the consequence that the locus where a whole *family* of characters takes its value at the
identity is the common kernel of that family (`FDRep.coe_iInf_ker`), a normal subgroup by
`FDRep.normal_iInf_ker` (`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/FDRep.lean`, that normality needing no
characters).

One direction is immediate: if `ρ g` is the identity then its trace is `finrank ℂ V`. The other is
not, and it is where the analysis enters. The eigenvalues of `ρ g` are roots of unity, so each has
real part at most `1`; the character value is those eigenvalues summed with the dimensions of the
eigenspaces as weights, and those dimensions add up to `finrank ℂ V`. Attaining the value
`finrank ℂ V` therefore forces every eigenvalue to have real part `1`, hence to be `1`, and `ρ g`
is diagonalizable, so it is the identity. That argument is carried out for a bare endomorphism in
`Module.End.trace_eq_finrank_iff`; here it is only transported to representations and characters.

Finite order is exactly what the statement needs, and it is all that is assumed here. For an element
of infinite order there is no constraint on the eigenvalues of `ρ g`, and the character can take the
value `finrank ℂ V` without `ρ g` being the identity: the representation of `ℤ` on `ℂ²` sending `n`
to the unipotent matrix with off-diagonal entry `n` has character constantly `2`, while no nonzero
`n` acts as the identity. The statements are therefore given first for an element with `g ^ n = 1`,
where the hypothesis is explicit, then for one of finite order; the statements about the whole
kernel assume `IsMulTorsion G`, which a finite group satisfies by `isOfFinOrder_of_finite`.

The restriction to `ℂ` is inherited from `Module.End.trace_eq_finrank_iff`, and is one of proof
rather than of substance: the equivalence holds over any field of characteristic zero, the
eigenvalues generating a cyclotomic subfield of the algebraic closure that embeds into `ℂ`. What the
proof compares are the real parts of the eigenvalues, which is what such an embedding buys; the
descent along one is not carried out, and `ℂ` is where the character theory downstream of this file
works.

The kernel description turns a character computation into a normal subgroup, as used in the
character-theoretic proof of Frobenius's theorem. The exceptional characters of
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Induction/ExceptionalCharacter.lean` are irreducible characters of
`G`, and the classical argument exhibits the Frobenius kernel `TauCeti.frobeniusKernel` as their
common kernel; `FDRep.coe_iInf_ker` and `FDRep.normal_iInf_ker` are the generic half of that step,
saying that such a common kernel is cut out by character equations and is a normal subgroup.

## Main statements

* `Representation.char_eq_finrank_iff_of_pow_eq_one` and `Representation.char_eq_finrank_iff`:
  **a complex character attains its degree at `g` exactly when `g` acts as the identity.**
* `Representation.mem_ker_iff_char_eq` and `FDRep.mem_ker_iff_char_eq`: the same, read as a
  description of the kernel; `FDRep.coe_ker` states it as an equality of sets.
* `FDRep.coe_iInf_ker`: **the locus where every member of a family of characters takes its value at
  the identity is the common kernel of that family**, which `FDRep.normal_iInf_ker`
  (`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/FDRep.lean`) records as a normal subgroup.
* `FDRep.ker_eq_ker_of_char_eq`: the kernel depends on the representation only through its
  character.
* `FDRep.ker_eq_top_iff` and `FDRep.ker_eq_bot_iff`: the kernel is everything exactly when the
  character is constant, and trivial exactly when the character detects the identity.
