# The Wedderburn blocks of `k[G]` classify its irreducible representations

A Wedderburn presentation `e : k[G] ≃ₐ[k] Π i, Matₙᵢ(k)` of a finite group algebra over an
algebraically closed field carries an irreducible representation on each block, and distinct blocks
carry inequivalent ones (`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/CharacterTable/BlockRepresentation.lean`).
This file supplies the missing half, that the list is **complete**: every finite-dimensional
irreducible representation of `G` over `k` is equivalent to a block representation. The block index
is therefore a faithful index of the irreducible representations up to equivalence, and everything
read off a presentation — first of all the multiset of degrees `nᵢ` — is an invariant of `G`.

Completeness is not a new argument: a family of pairwise inequivalent irreducibles indexed by as
many indices as `G` has conjugacy classes already exhausts the irreducibles
(`TauCeti.ClassFunction.exists_nonempty_equiv`), and a presentation has exactly that many blocks
(`TauCeti.card_eq_card_conjClasses_of_algEquiv_pi_matrix`). What was missing was the assembly, and
the invariance statements it unlocks.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.exists_nonempty_equiv_blockRepresentation`: **every irreducible representation of `G` is
  equivalent to a block representation**, so the blocks are a complete irredundant list.
* `TauCeti.exists_degree_eq_finrank`: the dimension of an irreducible representation is the degree
  of the block it matches, and `TauCeti.exists_isIrreducible_finrank_eq` is the converse, that each
  degree is realized.
* `TauCeti.exists_equiv_blockRepresentation`: **two Wedderburn presentations of `k[G]` differ by a
  permutation of the blocks**, matching degrees and block representations.
* `TauCeti.natCard_degree_fiber_eq`: **the multiset of degrees does not depend on the
  presentation**, in the form that each degree occurs equally often in the two.
* `AlgEquiv.nonempty_equiv_index_simpleSubmoduleClasses`: the block index is in bijection with the
  isomorphism classes of simple `k[G]`-modules.

## Implementation notes

The degree multiset is compared through the cardinalities of the fibres of the degree function,
`Nat.card {i // d i = n}`, rather than through `Multiset.map d Finset.univ.val`: the index types
carry `Finite` rather than `Fintype`, and the fibre form needs no decidability or enumeration and
says the same thing.

The `[∀ i, NeZero (d i)]` hypotheses are essential throughout, exactly as in
`IsSemisimpleRing.exists_ringEquiv_pi_matrix_divisionRing`, which produces them: a block of size
zero is the trivial ring, carries no representation, and could be inserted into any presentation
without changing the product, so without positivity neither the block count nor the degree multiset
would be an invariant.

Only the *representation*-level dictionary is new here. The module-level one, that the blocks of a
presentation of any semisimple ring are in bijection with the isomorphism classes of its simple
modules, is `RingEquiv.nonempty_equiv_simpleSubmoduleClasses_of_pi`; its group-algebra case
is recorded below as a corollary, since the two dictionaries are what
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/CharacterTable/Wedderburn.lean` names as the statements needed before
its block count may be called the count of irreducible representations.
