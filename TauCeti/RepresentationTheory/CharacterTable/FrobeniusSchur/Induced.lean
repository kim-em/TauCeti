# The Frobenius-Schur indicator of a character induced from an index-two subgroup

Let `N` be a subgroup of index two in a finite group `G` on which some element `s` outside `N` acts
by inversion, `s * x * s⁻¹ = x⁻¹`, and let `ψ` be a linear character of `N`, valued in a field `k`
in which the order of `G` is invertible, that is not its own inverse.  Inducing `ψ` gives a
two-dimensional representation of `G`, and this file computes its **Frobenius-Schur indicator**
under that invertibility hypothesis: it is `ψ (s ^ 2)`, the value of `ψ` on the common square of
the elements outside `N`.

This is the shape of a dihedral group over its rotations and of a dicyclic group over its cyclic
subgroup, so for such a group the indicator of an induced linear character is read off the square
of a single element outside the subgroup; the dihedral instance is in
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/CharacterTable/FrobeniusSchur/Dihedral.lean`.

The computation reads the character formula
`TauCeti.character_indFDRep_ofLinearCharacter_eq_add_inv_of_mem_of_conj_eq_inv` against the two
elementary facts about the outside coset recorded in `TauCeti/GroupTheory/Index/Two.lean`: its
elements all have the same square (`TauCeti.sq_eq_sq_of_notMem_of_index_two`), and that square
squares to one (`TauCeti.sq_sq_eq_one_of_conj_eq_inv`).  Inside `N` the character of the induced
representation at `g ^ 2` is `ψ² (g) + (ψ²)⁻¹ (g)`, and `ψ ^ 2 ≠ 1` makes both of those characters
nontrivial, so their sums over `N` vanish (`sum_hom_units_eq_zero`).

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.frobeniusSchurIndicator_indFDRep_ofLinearCharacter_eq_apply_sq_of_conj_eq_inv`: **the
  indicator of the representation induced from a linear character of an inverted subgroup of index
  two is the value of the character on the common square of the outside elements**, whenever the
  order of the group is invertible in the coefficient field.

/-- **The Frobenius-Schur indicator of a character induced from an inverted subgroup of index
two** is the value of the character on the common square `s ^ 2` of the elements outside the
subgroup.  The hypothesis `ψ ^ 2 ≠ 1` says that `ψ` is not its own inverse, and `hG` that the order
of `G` is invertible in `k`.  That `s` lies outside `N` need not be assumed, being already a
consequence of those two hypotheses. -/
