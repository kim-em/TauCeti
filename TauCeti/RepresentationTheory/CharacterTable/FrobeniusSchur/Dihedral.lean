# The Frobenius-Schur indicator of the two-dimensional representation of `D₄`

The rotation subgroup of `D₄` has index two and is inverted by every reflection, so the
Frobenius-Schur indicator of the representation induced from a linear character of it is given by
`TauCeti.frobeniusSchurIndicator_indFDRep_ofLinearCharacter_eq_apply_sq_of_conj_eq_inv`.  This
file evaluates that formula at the faithful character sending `r 1` to `i`, whose induced
representation is the two-dimensional irreducible of `D₄` by
`TauCeti.simple_indFDRep_ofLinearCharacter_dihedralGroupFourRotationChar`: the indicator is `1`.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.frobeniusSchurIndicator_indFDRep_ofLinearCharacter_dihedralGroupFourRotationChar_eq_one`:
  **the representation of `D₄` induced from the faithful character of its rotation subgroup has
  Frobenius-Schur indicator `1`.**  It is a `simp` lemma, stated on the underlying representation
  so that it matches after `TauCeti.FDRep.frobeniusSchurIndicator_def` has fired.

/-- **The representation of `D₄` over `ℂ` induced from the faithful linear character of the
rotation subgroup sending `r 1` to `i` has Frobenius-Schur indicator `1`.**  That representation
is the two-dimensional irreducible of `D₄`, by
`TauCeti.simple_indFDRep_ofLinearCharacter_dihedralGroupFourRotationChar` and
`TauCeti.finrank_indFDRep_ofLinearCharacter_dihedralGroupFourRotationChar`.  The value is stated
on the module spine, which is where the `simp` lemma `TauCeti.FDRep.frobeniusSchurIndicator_def`
sends the `FDRep`-level indicator, so `simp` normalizes either spelling to `1`. -/
