# Good Dixon primes

The Burnside--Dixon--Schneider algorithm computes the complex character table of a finite group
`G` by working over a finite prime field `ZMod p` and lifting the answer back. The prime it works
over cannot be arbitrary: it has to make `ZMod p` behave, for the purposes of the computation, like
`ℂ`, and it has to be large enough that the lift is unambiguous. This file isolates that condition
as `TauCeti.IsGoodDixonPrime` and proves what it buys.

Three arithmetic conditions do the work. That `p` does not divide `|G|` makes `ZMod p [G]`
semisimple, by Maschke. That the exponent `e` of `G` divides `p - 1` makes every element of `G` act
with eigenvalues in `ZMod p`, because the `e`-th roots of unity are already there: `ZMod p` contains
a primitive `e`-th root of unity and `X ^ e - 1` splits into distinct linear factors over it. And
Dixon's size bound `2⌊√|G|⌋ < p` opens a residue window wide enough that an integer of absolute
value at most `√|G|` -- the size of the coefficients the algorithm has to reconstruct -- is
determined by its residue modulo `p`.

Such primes always exist: there are arbitrarily large primes congruent to `1` modulo `e`
(`Nat.exists_prime_gt_modEq_one`, itself a cyclotomic-polynomial argument), and any of them beyond
`max |G| (2⌊√|G|⌋)` is good. The existence proof is not part of any computation. What the
computation does instead is search: `TauCeti.DixonPrimeData.candidates` tests the numbers
`e + 1, 2e + 1, 3e + 1, …` in turn, keeps the good primes among them, and pairs each with the least
primitive `e`-th root of unity modulo it (`TauCeti.ZMod.primitiveRoot?`). The existence theorem
then says that the search reaches every good prime once it runs far enough
(`TauCeti.DixonPrimeData.exists_mem_candidates`).

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.IsGoodDixonPrime`: the good-prime predicate.
* `TauCeti.DixonPrimeData`: a good prime together with a choice of primitive `e`-th root of unity
  modulo it, the data the algorithm consumes.
* `TauCeti.DixonPrimeData.ofPrime?`: the Dixon prime data at a given prime, if it is good.
* `TauCeti.DixonPrimeData.candidates`: the Dixon prime data at the good primes among the first
  numbers congruent to `1` modulo the exponent.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.IsGoodDixonPrime.isSemisimpleRing`: the modular group algebra is semisimple.
* `TauCeti.IsGoodDixonPrime.exists_isPrimitiveRoot` and
  `TauCeti.IsGoodDixonPrime.splits_X_pow_exponent_sub_one`: `ZMod p` splits `X ^ e - 1`.
* `TauCeti.IsGoodDixonPrime.card_nthRootsFinset`: that splitting has `e` distinct roots.
* `TauCeti.IsGoodDixonPrime.isSemisimple_apply`: every group element acts semisimply in a
  representation over `ZMod p`.
* `TauCeti.IsGoodDixonPrime.two_mul_natAbs_lt_of_natAbs_le_sqrt`,
  `TauCeti.IsGoodDixonPrime.valMinAbs_intCast_of_natAbs_le_sqrt` and
  `TauCeti.IsGoodDixonPrime.eq_of_intCast_eq_of_natAbs_le_sqrt`: an integer bounded by `√|G|` is
  recovered from, and so determined by, its residue modulo `p`. This is what the size bound is
  for.
* `TauCeti.exists_isGoodDixonPrime`: **good Dixon primes exist** for every finite group.
* `TauCeti.DixonPrimeData.isSome_ofPrime?_iff`: the data at `p` is found exactly when `p` is a
  good Dixon prime.
* `TauCeti.DixonPrimeData.mem_candidates_iff` and `TauCeti.DixonPrimeData.exists_mem_candidates`:
  the search returns the data at every good prime within its range, and nothing else.

## Implementation notes

`TauCeti.DixonPrimeData` carries the primitive root as a field rather than choosing one with the
axiom of choice, because the algorithm that consumes it is meant to run: a noncomputable root would
make every downstream `def` noncomputable. The existence statement is therefore phrased twice, once
as the proposition `TauCeti.exists_isGoodDixonPrime` and once as
`TauCeti.instNonemptyDixonPrimeData`.

/-! ### The good-prime predicate -/

/-- **`p` is a good Dixon prime for `G`**: it is prime, it does not divide `|G|`, the exponent of
`G` divides `p - 1`, and it exceeds Dixon's size bound `2⌊√|G|⌋`.

These are exactly the arithmetic hypotheses under which the Burnside--Dixon--Schneider algorithm
runs: `not_dvd_natCard` makes `ZMod p [G]` semisimple, `exponent_dvd` puts the `e`-th roots of
unity into `ZMod p`, and `two_mul_sqrt_lt` makes the lift back to characteristic zero unique. That
the reduced central characters stay pairwise distinct is *not* part of the definition; it is a
consequence, the content of the good-prime structure theorem. -/

  /-- `p` is prime, so that `ZMod p` is a field. -/

/-! #### The exponent condition -/

/-- **`ZMod p` contains a primitive root of unity of order the exponent of `G`.** This is the
exponent condition at work: the exponent divides `p - 1`, and `ZMod p` has the roots of unity of
every order dividing `p - 1`, by `TauCeti.ZMod.exists_isPrimitiveRoot_of_dvd_sub_one`. -/

/-! #### Splitting the roots of unity -/

/-- **`X ^ e - 1` splits over `ZMod p`**, `e` the exponent of `G`: this is the sense in which a
good Dixon prime makes `ZMod p` a substitute for `ℂ`. -/
theorem splits_X_pow_exponent_sub_one (hp : IsGoodDixonPrime G p) :

  have := hp.fact_prime
  obtain ⟨ζ, hζ⟩ := hp.exists_isPrimitiveRoot
  simpa using X_pow_sub_one_splits hζ

/-- The `e`-th roots of unity in `ZMod p` are `e` in number: `X ^ e - 1` splits with *distinct*
roots, which is what makes the elements of `G` act semisimply.

The `Fact` instance is redundant with `hp.prime`, but it cannot be dropped:
`Polynomial.nthRootsFinset` is defined only over an `IsDomain`, and `IsDomain (ZMod p)` is found
from `Fact p.Prime`, so without the instance argument the *statement* fails to elaborate. Deriving
it inside the proof is therefore not an option, unlike in
`TauCeti.IsGoodDixonPrime.splits_X_pow_exponent_sub_one`, whose `Polynomial.Splits` is defined over
any commutative ring. -/
theorem card_nthRootsFinset [Fact p.Prime] (hp : IsGoodDixonPrime G p) :

  omega

/-- **The certified rational-integer lift at a good Dixon prime.** Dixon's size bound opens a
residue window wide enough that an integer of absolute value at most `⌊√|G|⌋` is returned by
`ZMod.valMinAbs` from its residue. This is the first stage of the cyclotomic lift: a rational
character value, reduced modulo `p`, is recovered exactly. -/
theorem valMinAbs_intCast_of_natAbs_le_sqrt (hp : IsGoodDixonPrime G p) {z : ℤ}
    (hz : z.natAbs ≤ Nat.sqrt (Nat.card G)) : ((z : ZMod p)).valMinAbs = z :=
  ZMod.valMinAbs_intCast_of_two_mul_natAbs_lt (hp.two_mul_natAbs_lt_of_natAbs_le_sqrt hz)

/-- **Dixon's size bound opens a wide enough residue window.** Two integers of absolute value at
most `⌊√|G|⌋` that agree modulo `p` are equal, so an integer of that size is determined by its
residue. This is why the lift is unambiguous. -/
theorem eq_of_intCast_eq_of_natAbs_le_sqrt (hp : IsGoodDixonPrime G p) {z w : ℤ}
    (hz : z.natAbs ≤ Nat.sqrt (Nat.card G)) (hw : w.natAbs ≤ Nat.sqrt (Nat.card G))

/-! #### Representations over `ZMod p` -/

section Representation

variable {V : Type*} [AddCommGroup V] [Module (ZMod p) V]

/-- **At a good Dixon prime every group element acts semisimply.** This is
`Representation.isSemisimple_apply` at the invertibility of `|G|` that the good-prime

/-! ### Existence -/

/-- **Good Dixon primes exist.** Take a prime congruent to `1` modulo the exponent of `G` and
larger than `max |G| (2⌊√|G|⌋)`, the second half being Dixon's size bound; there are arbitrarily
large such primes. This is a statement about the algorithm, not a step in it: a concrete group is
handed a concrete prime instead. -/

/-! ### Searching for Dixon prime data

The order and the exponent of `G` enter the search as natural numbers `n` and `e`, together with
proofs that they are `Nat.card G` and `Monoid.exponent G`: Mathlib's `Monoid.exponent` is
noncomputable, and a caller that runs the search supplies the two numbers it already knows. -/
