# Cyclotomic Dixon recovery for S₄

The integer certificate for `S₄` also certifies recovery by the general cyclotomic solver.
The largest absolute central-character entry is `8`, so every Dixon prime greater than `16`
has a sufficiently large balanced residue window.

`TauCeti.isSome_dixonCyclotomicCharacterTable_symmetricGroupFour` proves success for any such
prime data, independently of its chosen primitive root. The ordinary table, central table,
and degrees are those already certified in
`TauCeti.RepresentationTheory.CharacterTable.Dixon.Rational.SymmetricFour`.

/-- The general cyclotomic Dixon solver recovers a certified character table of `S₄` at every
Dixon prime greater than `16`. The bound concerns central characters, including their entry `8`,
rather than just the smaller ordinary character values. -/
