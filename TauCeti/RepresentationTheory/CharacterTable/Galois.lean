# The Galois action on character values

A character value `χ(g)` at an element with `g ^ n = 1` is a sum of `n`-th roots of unity, the
eigenvalues of `ρ g`, weighted by the dimensions of the eigenspaces. A ring endomorphism `σ` of the
coefficient field fixes those dimensions, which enter as natural numbers, so it acts on `χ(g)` only
through its action on the roots of unity. The roots of unity form a cyclic group, so `σ` acts on
them as a power map `μ ↦ μ ^ j`, and then `σ (χ(g)) = ∑ dim(V_μ) · μ ^ j = χ(g ^ j)`: **the Galois
action on character values is by power maps of the group element**.

This file proves that identity, first for an arbitrary ring endomorphism of an algebraically closed
field and then, over `ℂ`, in the form the character-theory roadmap asks for, with the exponent `j`
supplied by Mathlib's cyclotomic character `IsPrimitiveRoot.autToPow`, which reads it off a chosen
primitive root of unity and an algebra automorphism. A field automorphism of `ℂ` is automatically
`ℚ`-linear, so `ℂ ≃ₐ[ℚ] ℂ` is the group of field automorphisms of `ℂ`; the endomorphism statement
above is the more general one, since a `ℚ`-linear ring homomorphism `ℂ →+* ℂ` is an embedding but
need not be surjective.

Complex conjugation is the instance `j = n - 1` of all this, and gives back
`TauCeti.Representation.conj_char_eq_char_inv`, `conj (χ g) = χ g⁻¹`.

Two consequences are recorded: `χ(g)` and `χ(g ^ j)` are conjugate algebraic numbers over `ℚ`
(they are `IsConjRoot ℚ`), and a character value that is rational is unchanged by the power maps
that automorphisms of `ℂ` realize.  For a representation already defined over `ℚ`, base change to
`AlgebraicClosure ℚ` realizes every coprime power and then descends the resulting character
identity back to `ℚ`.

Only the direction "an automorphism determines the power map" is proved here. The converse
direction, that every `j` coprime to the exponent is realized by some `σ : ℂ →+* ℂ`, needs a
cyclotomic Galois automorphism to be extended along a transcendence basis of `ℂ`, and is not proved
here; the identity above is the load-bearing half, and it is the half the Dixon-Schneider lift
consumes once such a `σ` is in hand.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.Representation.map_character_eq_character_pow`: if `σ` raises every `n`-th root of unity
  to the `j`-th power and `g ^ n = 1`, then `σ (χ(g)) = χ(g ^ j)`. The variant
  `TauCeti.Representation.map_character_eq_character_pow_of_isPrimitiveRoot` witnesses the power on
  a single primitive root of unity.
* `TauCeti.Representation.map_ofCharacter_eq_powMap`: on a group of exponent dividing `n` the
  Galois twist `σ ∘ χ` is the power-map twist `TauCeti.ClassFunction.powMap j` of the class
  function of `χ`, so the twist is an operation on `ClassFunction k G`.
* `FDRep.map_character_eq_character_pow_of_isPrimitiveRoot`: over `ℂ`, a field
  automorphism `f` of `ℂ` sends `χ(g)` to `χ(g ^ j)`, with `j` the cyclotomic exponent
  `IsPrimitiveRoot.autToPow` attaches to `f`.
* `FDRep.isConjRoot_character_pow`: `χ(g)` and `χ(g ^ j)` are conjugate over `ℚ`.
* `FDRep.character_pow_eq_character_of_mem_range`: a rational character value is unchanged
  by the power maps that automorphisms of `ℂ` realize.
* `FDRep.character_pow_eq_character_of_coprime`: a rational representation has equal character
  values on coprime powers.
* `FDRep.character_eq_of_zpowers_eq`: a rational character has the same value on elements that
  generate the same cyclic subgroup.
