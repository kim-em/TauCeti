# The Steinberg representation of `GL₂(𝔽_q)`

The Borel subgroup `B` of `GL₂(𝔽_q)` has index `q + 1`, and `GL₂` permutes the cosets `GL₂ ⧸ B`
— the points of the projective line. The resulting permutation representation `ℂ[GL₂ ⧸ B]` has the
same character as the principal series `Ind_B^{GL₂}(1 ⊗ 1)` of
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/CharacterTable/GL2/PrincipalSeries/Basic.lean` at the boundary value
`α = β = 1`, where it is reducible: it contains the line spanned by the sum of the cosets, on
which `GL₂` acts trivially. The complement of that line is the **Steinberg representation**
`TauCeti.GL2Steinberg`, of dimension `q`.

This file builds it as the augmentation subrepresentation of `ℂ[GL₂ ⧸ B]` — the elements whose
coefficients sum to zero, of `TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Augmentation.lean` — and computes its
dimension and its character. The character values are the fixed-coset counts less one, and the
Bruhat decomposition then gives the character-theoretic form of irreducibility: the Steinberg
character has norm `1` for the character pairing of
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/CharacterTable/Pairing.lean`. Everything proved here is an identity
between characters; irreducibility itself is not proved here. The splitting of the boundary
principal series as a representation is `TauCeti.nonempty_iso_GL2PrincipalSeries_self` in
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/CharacterTable/GL2/Boundary.lean`.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.GL2Steinberg`: the Steinberg representation of `GL₂(𝔽_q)`.
* `TauCeti.GL2SteinbergEquiv`: it carries the augmentation subrepresentation of `ℂ[GL₂ ⧸ B]`, so
  that consumers can read anything about it off that subrepresentation.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.finrank_GL2Steinberg`: the Steinberg representation has dimension `q`. Its character at
  the identity is that dimension, by Mathlib's `FDRep.char_one`.
* `TauCeti.character_GL2Steinberg`: its character at `g` is the number of cosets of `B` fixed by
  `g`, less one.
* `TauCeti.character_GL2PrincipalSeries_one_one_eq_character_ofMulAction`: the boundary principal
  series `TauCeti.GL2PrincipalSeries F 1 1` has the character of `ℂ[GL₂ ⧸ B]`, whence
  `TauCeti.character_GL2PrincipalSeries_one_one_eq_one_add`: its character is the trivial character
  `1` plus the Steinberg character.
* `TauCeti.characterPairing_GL2Steinberg_self`: the Steinberg character has norm `1`, by
  `TauCeti.characterPairing_ofMulAction_quotient_sub_punit_eq_card_doubleCosetQuotient_sub_one`
  and the two double cosets of the Bruhat decomposition.

## Implementation notes

An object of `FDRep ℂ G` carries a `ℂ`-module in `Type`, while the coset space `GL₂(F) ⧸ B` lies
in the universe of `F`; `TauCeti.GL2Steinberg` therefore transports the carrier down with
`FDRep.ofShrink`, exactly as `TauCeti.indFDRep` does for induced representations, so that the
construction stays universe-polymorphic in `F`. The transport itself is never reasoned about here:
the dimension and the character below go through the generic transfer lemmas
`FDRep.finrank_ofShrink` and `FDRep.character_ofShrink`, and `TauCeti.GL2SteinbergEquiv` — the
comparison equivalence that `FDRep.ofShrinkEquiv` supplies — is public so that consumers can read
off anything else the same way. It is not a restatement they could do without: the body of
`TauCeti.GL2Steinberg` is not exposed, so `FDRep.ofShrinkEquiv` does not elaborate at that type
outside this file.

`TauCeti.characterPairing_GL2Steinberg_self` carries a `[DecidableEq F]` hypothesis, which the
other statements do not. It is used, not decorative: `TauCeti.ClassFunction.characterPairing`
averages over a `Fintype` of the group, and a `Fintype (GL (Fin 2) F)` instance needs decidable
equality on the matrix entries.

The irreducibility of the Steinberg representation is packaged downstream as
`TauCeti.simple_GL2Steinberg`, using the norm computed here and Mathlib's
`FDRep.simple_iff_char_is_norm_one`. That criterion is stated for a coefficient field and a group
in the same universe, so the downstream theorem necessarily pins `F : Type`; keeping it out of
this file preserves the universe polymorphism of the construction and character computation. It
also keeps the fundamental theorem of algebra, needed for the `IsAlgClosed ℂ` instance, out of
this foundational module.

/-! ### The definition and the dimension -/

/-- **The Steinberg representation of `GL₂(𝔽_q)`**: the augmentation subrepresentation of the
permutation representation `ℂ[GL₂ ⧸ B]` on the cosets of the Borel subgroup, that is, the
complement of its invariant line. It has dimension `q`, and `ℂ[GL₂ ⧸ B]` has the character of the
boundary principal series `Ind_B^{GL₂}(1 ⊗ 1)`. -/

/-- **The Steinberg representation carries the augmentation subrepresentation of `ℂ[GL₂ ⧸ B]`.**
Shrinking the carrier to `Type` is a change of model, not of representation, so everything about
`TauCeti.GL2Steinberg` may be read off the augmentation subrepresentation through this
equivalence. -/

the coset space. This is `TauCeti.GL2Borel.index_eq` at the `Fintype.card` spelling that the

accounts for exactly `1` of it. -/

projective line.** At `α = β = 1` the character of `Ind_B^{GL₂}(1 ⊗ 1)` is the character of
`ℂ[GL₂ ⧸ B]`, because inducing the trivial character of `B` is inducing the trivial
representation. The two representations are only shown to have the same character here, not
identified. -/

`1` is the trivial character, carried by the invariant line of `ℂ[GL₂ ⧸ B]`. This is the

representations is `TauCeti.nonempty_iso_GL2PrincipalSeries_self`. -/
