# The character of the principal series of `GL₂(𝔽_q)` on the four families of conjugacy classes

The conjugacy classes of `GL₂(𝔽_q)` fall into four families
(`TauCeti/LinearAlgebra/Matrix/GeneralLinearGroup/ConjugacyClasses.lean`), with representatives
the **central** scalar `diag(a, a)`, the **split semisimple** `diag(a, b)` with `a ≠ b`, the
**non-semisimple** Jordan block `!![a, b; 0, a]` with `b ≠ 0`, and the **elliptic** image of an
element of `E ∖ F` under the non-split torus of a quadratic extension `E/F`. This file evaluates
the character of the principal series `Ind_B^{GL₂}(α ⊗ β)` at each of the four, giving the row

`χ_{α,β} = (q + 1) α(a) β(a)`, `α(a) β(b) + α(b) β(a)`, `α(a) β(a)`, `0`

of the character table of `GL₂(𝔽_q)`. At `α = β = 1` these are the fixed-point counts on the
projective line, which is the boundary case
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/CharacterTable/GL2/CharacterValues.lean` reads off.

The computation is the induced-character formula in the form
`Subgroup.indClassFun_eq_sum_of_smul_eq_self_mem`: the character of an induction at `g` is the sum
of the inducing character over the cosets of `B` that `g` fixes, evaluated at the conjugate of `g`
into `B` that each such coset exhibits. Which cosets are fixed is already known — a scalar fixes
all `q + 1` of them, a split semisimple element exactly `2`, a Jordan block exactly `1`, and an
elliptic element none
(`TauCeti/LinearAlgebra/Matrix/GeneralLinearGroup/ProjectiveLine.lean`) — and those counts are
enough to *identify* the fixed cosets, because in each case a list of that many fixed cosets is at
hand: the trivial coset `B` and, for a split semisimple element, the coset of the Weyl element
`w = !![0, 1; 1, 0]`. Conjugating `diag(a, b)` by `w` swaps the two entries, which is where the
second summand `α(b) β(a)` comes from.

Only the central formula contains `q`, as the index `q + 1` of the Borel subgroup, and it is the
one whose fixed-coset count `TauCeti.GL2Borel.natCard_fixedCosets_scalar` is about a finite field.
The other three counts hold over any field; all four proofs still need `F` finite, because the
coset sum they run on is the one of a finite-index subgroup.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.character_GL2PrincipalSeries_scalar`, `TauCeti.character_GL2PrincipalSeries_diagGL`,
  `TauCeti.character_GL2PrincipalSeries_jordanGL` and
  `TauCeti.character_GL2PrincipalSeries_gl2NonSplitTorusHom`: the four values above.

/-- Conjugating a diagonal matrix by the Weyl element swaps its two entries. This is
`TauCeti.permutationGL_mul_diagGL_mul_inv` at the transposition, which
`TauCeti.gl2WeylElement_eq_permutationGL_swap` identifies the Weyl element with.

`TauCeti.GL2Borel.inv_weyl_mul_torusHom_mul_weyl` is the same fact for the split torus
`TauCeti.GL2Borel.torusHom` of the Borel subgroup rather than for `TauCeti.diagGL`. The two
presentations of a diagonal matrix are equal but not definitionally so, and the conjugacy-class
representatives of `GL₂(𝔽_q)` are stated with `TauCeti.diagGL`; nothing is recomputed here, the
general permutation lemma above does the work. -/
