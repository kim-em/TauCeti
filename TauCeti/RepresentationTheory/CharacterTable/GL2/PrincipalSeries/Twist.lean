# Twisting the principal series of `GL₂(𝔽_q)` by a determinant character

Multiplying both parameters of the principal series by a character `γ : Fˣ →* ℂˣ` multiplies its
character by the determinant character `γ ∘ det`:

`χ(Ind_B^{GL₂}(γα ⊗ γβ)) = (γ ∘ det) · χ(Ind_B^{GL₂}(α ⊗ β))`.

This is the projection formula for induced class functions, because the Borel character
`γα ⊗ γβ` is the pointwise product of `α ⊗ β` with the restriction of `γ ∘ det` to the Borel
subgroup (`TauCeti.GL2LinearChar_comp_gl2BorelSubtype`).

At `α = β = 1` the identity turns the character of the permutation representation on the
projective line into the character of the principal series at the repeated parameter `(γ, γ)`,
which is how
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/CharacterTable/GL2/Boundary.lean` splits that principal series.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.character_GL2PrincipalSeries_mul_eq_mul`: twisting both principal-series parameters by
  `γ` multiplies the induced character by the determinant character of `γ`.

  formula for induced characters.

/-- **Twisting both principal-series parameters multiplies the character by a determinant
character.** For `γ α β : Fˣ → ℂˣ`, the equality
`χ(Ind_B^GL₂(γα ⊗ γβ)) = (γ ∘ det) · χ(Ind_B^GL₂(α ⊗ β))`. At `α = β = 1`,
this identifies the repeated-parameter principal-series character as a determinant twist of the
untwisted boundary character. -/
