# The character integral counts the intertwiners

For finite-dimensional continuous representations `π` on `V` and `ρ` on `W` of a compact group,

`∫ g, χ_π(g⁻¹) · χ_ρ(g) ∂(haarProb G) = dim Hom_G(V, W)`,

the dimension being that of Mathlib's `ContIntertwiningMap π ρ`. This is the compact-group form of
the finite-group identity `|G|⁻¹ ∑ g, χ_ρ(g) · χ_π(g⁻¹) = dim Hom_G(V, W)`
(`Representation.card_inv_mul_sum_char_mul_char_eq_finrank`), with the Haar integral in place of
the normalized sum.

The proof is the composition of two facts already available and needs no new analysis. The Hom
representation of `TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Continuous/LinHom.lean` has the intertwiners as its
invariants and `χ_π(g⁻¹) · χ_ρ(g)` as its character, and Haar averaging counts the invariants of a
representation by integrating its character
(`ContRepresentation.integral_character_eq_finrank_invariants`). Applying the second to the
first is the theorem.

For a **unitary** `π` the character at an inverse is the conjugate of the character
(`ContRepresentation.character_apply_inv`), so the integrand becomes `conj χ_π · χ_ρ`, the
`L²` pairing of the two characters. In that form the theorem is the quantitative statement behind
Schur orthogonality: the pairing of the characters of two irreducibles is the dimension of the
space of intertwiners between them. That dimension is `0` when the two admit no nonzero
intertwiner, and for an irreducible against itself it is the dimension of its endomorphism
division algebra — which Schur's lemma makes `1` only over algebraically closed scalars, and which
over `ℝ` is `1`, `2` or `4`. This is why `ContRepresentation.character_orthonormal_self`
carries `[IsAlgClosed 𝕜]` while `character_orthonormal_distinct` does not.

## Main statements

* `ContRepresentation.integral_character_mul_eq_finrank_contIntertwiningMap`: the character
  integral is the dimension of the space of continuous intertwiners.
* `ContRepresentation.integral_star_character_mul_eq_finrank_contIntertwiningMap`: the same
  with the conjugate character, for a unitary representation.
* `ContRepresentation.inner_characterLp_eq_finrank_contIntertwiningMap`: the same read as
  the `L²` inner product of the two characters.
* `ContRepresentation.integral_character_mul_eq_zero_iff`: the integral vanishes exactly
  when every continuous intertwiner is zero.
