# Characters are class functions in `L²(G)`

The character of a finite-dimensional continuous representation of a compact group is a class
function: it is constant on conjugacy classes.  Passing to `L²(G)` this becomes a statement about
an almost-everywhere equivalence class, and the correct home for it is the closed subspace
`TauCeti.classFunctionLp` of classes fixed by every conjugation.

This file proves that a continuous class function lands in that subspace, and specializes to
characters.  Together with the orthogonality relations of
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Compact/Character/Basic.lean` this says the irreducible characters
form an orthonormal system *inside* `classFunctionLp`; that they are a Hilbert basis of it -- the
compact-group form of "the irreducible characters are a basis of the class functions" -- needs the
Peter-Weyl theorem and is proved in
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Compact/Character/Basis.lean`.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.toLp_mem_classFunctionLp`: a continuous class function on a compact group defines an
  element of `classFunctionLp`.
* `ContRepresentation.characterLp_mem_classFunctionLp`: the character of a
  finite-dimensional continuous representation is a class function in `L²(G)`.
