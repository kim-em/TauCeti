# The Frobenius-Schur indicator counts invariant tensors

For a finite-dimensional continuous representation `π` of a compact group `G`, the Frobenius-Schur
indicator `ν₂(π) = ∫_G χ_π(g²) dμ` of
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Compact/FrobeniusSchur/Basic.lean` is the **signed count of invariant
tensors**,

`ν₂(π) = dim (Sym²V)ᴳ - dim (Λ²V)ᴳ`,

the compact-group form of the finite-group identity
`TauCeti.Representation.frobeniusSchurIndicator_eq_sub_finrank_invariants`.

The two squares are realized *inside* the tensor square `V ⊗[ℂ] V`, as the two eigenspaces of the
flip `x ⊗ y ↦ y ⊗ x` (`TauCeti.symmetricTensors` and `TauCeti.antisymmetricTensors`). That is not
a matter of taste: Haar averaging counts the invariants of a *continuous* representation, so the
carrier has to be a topological vector space, and the tensor square of a complex inner product
space is one, whereas `Sym[ℂ]^2 V` and `⋀[ℂ]^2 V` — a quotient and a subobject of a
`PiTensorProduct` — carry no topology. In characteristic zero the eigenspaces are the symmetric and
exterior squares, so nothing is lost.

With the squares realized that way the proof is short. The tensor square of `π` is
`ContRepresentation.tprod π π`, the flip commutes with it, so each eigenspace is a
subrepresentation, and their characters differ by `χ_π(g²)`: this is
`ContRepresentation.character_symmetricSquare_sub_character_exteriorSquare`, whose linear-algebra
content is that composing `f ⊗ f` with the flip has trace `tr (f ∘ f)`. Integrating that pointwise
identity and reading each character integral as a dimension of invariants
(`ContRepresentation.integral_character_eq_finrank_invariants`) is the theorem.

Neither the two squares nor their character identity needs any of the analysis, so neither is built
here: the squares are defined and shown continuous, and their characters are compared, for a
continuous representation of a monoid on an inner product space over `RCLike 𝕜` in
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Continuous/Square/Basic.lean` and
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Continuous/Square/Character.lean`. Only the indicator statements
below ask for a compact group and `𝕜 = ℂ`.

## Main statements

* `ContRepresentation.frobeniusSchurIndicator_eq_sub_finrank_invariants`: **the Frobenius-Schur
  indicator is the signed count of invariant tensors**,
  `ν₂(π) = dim (Sym²V)ᴳ - dim (Λ²V)ᴳ`.
* `ContRepresentation.frobeniusSchurIndicator_eq_intCast`: it is therefore an integer, the first
  half of the reality trichotomy.

## Implementation notes

The carrier of `ContRepresentation.character` is pinned by name at every use below, as
`character (𝕜 := ℂ) (V := symmetricTensors ℂ V) ...`. It has to be: the carrier is an implicit
argument that the elaborator would have to read off the coercion `⇑(symmetricSquare π)`, and a
submodule of `V ⊗[ℂ] V` receives its topology both as a subtype and through the norm its
`NormedAddCommGroup` instance carries, so that unification stalls between the two instance paths.
Pinning the carrier costs a few characters and makes every statement below elaborate on the first
try.

## References

The indicator is defined in `TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Compact/FrobeniusSchur/Basic.lean`,
and the invariant counts use `TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Compact/Invariants.lean`. The
trichotomy `ν₂ ∈ {1, 0, -1}` is proved in
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Compact/FrobeniusSchur/Trichotomy.lean`. The mathematical development
follows Daniel Bump, *Lie Groups*, second edition, Chapter 2, and T. Bröcker and T. tom Dieck,
