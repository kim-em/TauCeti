# The Frobenius-Schur reality trichotomy for compact groups

For an irreducible unitary representation `π` of a compact group on a finite-dimensional complex
inner product space, the Frobenius-Schur indicator takes only the three values

`ν₂(π) = 1`, `ν₂(π) = 0`, `ν₂(π) = -1`,

and which value occurs is read off the invariants of the symmetric and of the exterior square. This
is the compact-group form of the finite-group
`TauCeti.Representation.frobeniusSchurIndicator_eq_one_or_eq_zero_or_eq_neg_one`.

Everything analytic is already done.
`ContRepresentation.frobeniusSchurIndicator_eq_sub_finrank_invariants`, in
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Compact/FrobeniusSchur/InvariantTensors.lean`, integrates the
character identity and reads the indicator as the signed count of invariant tensors,

`ν₂(π) = dim (Sym²V)ᴳ - dim (Λ²V)ᴳ`.

What remained was the bound on the two counts, and that is pure linear algebra plus Schur's lemma:
`ContRepresentation.finrank_invariants_squares_le_one`, in
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Continuous/Square/Invariants.lean`, says the two dimensions add up to
at most `1`, because the invariants of the tensor square of an irreducible are at most a line and
the two squares meet in `0`. A difference of two non-negative integers whose sum is at most `1` is
`1`, `0` or `-1`, and each value is pinned by which of the two squares carries the invariant.

The trichotomy is stated here for the indicator and the two invariant counts only. Its refinement
into the invariant-form dictionary -- that `ν₂ = 1` is the existence of a nonzero invariant
*symmetric* bilinear form and `ν₂ = -1` that of an invariant *alternating* one -- is
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Compact/FrobeniusSchur/InvariantForm.lean`, which reads the two
invariant counts off invariant forms through
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Continuous/Square/BilinearForm.lean`; the finite-group version of
that dictionary is `TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/CharacterTable/FrobeniusSchur/Trichotomy.lean`.
What is still *not* established is the structure-map reformulation over `ℝ`, which reads the three
values as the **real**, **complex** and **quaternionic** types.

## Main statements

* `ContRepresentation.frobeniusSchurIndicator_trichotomy`: **the indicator of an irreducible
  unitary representation of a compact group is `1`, `0` or `-1`.**
* `ContRepresentation.frobeniusSchurIndicator_eq_one_iff_finrank_invariants_symmetricSquare`,
  `ContRepresentation.frobeniusSchurIndicator_eq_neg_one_iff_finrank_invariants_exteriorSquare`
  and `ContRepresentation.frobeniusSchurIndicator_eq_zero_iff_finrank_invariants_squares`: which
  of the three values occurs, read off the invariants of the two squares.

/-- **The Frobenius-Schur reality trichotomy for compact groups.** The indicator of an irreducible
unitary representation of a compact group on a finite-dimensional complex inner product space is
`1`, `0` or `-1`.

The indicator is the difference `dim (Sym²V)ᴳ - dim (Λ²V)ᴳ`
(`ContRepresentation.frobeniusSchurIndicator_eq_sub_finrank_invariants`) and those two dimensions
add up to at most `1` (`ContRepresentation.finrank_invariants_squares_le_one`), so the difference
is one of the three values. -/
