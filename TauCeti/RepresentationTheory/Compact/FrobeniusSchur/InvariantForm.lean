# The Frobenius-Schur trichotomy of a compact group, read off invariant forms

`ContRepresentation.frobeniusSchurIndicator_trichotomy` says that the indicator of an irreducible
unitary representation of a compact group is `1`, `0` or `-1`, and pins which value occurs by the
invariants of the symmetric and of the exterior square. This file replaces those two invariant
counts by invariant **bilinear forms**:

`ν₂(π) = 1` iff `π` carries a nondegenerate invariant **symmetric** bilinear form,
`ν₂(π) = -1` iff it carries a nondegenerate invariant **alternating** one,
`ν₂(π) = 0` iff it carries no nonzero invariant bilinear form at all.

That is as far as this file goes: the classical reading of the three values as the real, complex
and quaternionic types — that `π` is the complexification of a real representation, that it is not
isomorphic to its conjugate, that it carries a quaternionic structure — is a further step, not
proved here, since none of the statements below mentions a structure map or a real or quaternionic
form.

The bridge is the inner-product dictionary of
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Continuous/Square/BilinearForm.lean`: a tensor `t` of `V ⊗[ℂ] V`
becomes the form `⟪t, v ⊗ₜ w⟫`, and that construction carries the symmetric tensors to the
symmetric forms, the antisymmetric tensors to the alternating forms, and — because the
representation is unitary — the invariant tensors to the invariant forms. So the two eigenspaces of
the flip that the trichotomy counts *are* the invariant symmetric and the invariant alternating
forms, and each of the three cases can be stated without mentioning the tensor square.

Two facts about an irreducible representation supply the rest, and both are consumed from
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/InvariantForm.lean`: a nonzero invariant form on an irreducible
representation is automatically nondegenerate
(`TauCeti.Representation.IsInvariantForm.nondegenerate`), which is why the statements below ask for
nondegeneracy rather than for nonvanishing; and over an algebraically closed field away from
characteristic two it carries a nonzero invariant symmetric form, a nonzero invariant alternating
one, or no nonzero invariant form at all
(`TauCeti.Representation.exists_isSymm_or_exists_isAlt_or_invariantForms_eq_bot`), which is what
makes the vanishing case `ν₂ = 0` say that there is no invariant form at all.

This is the compact-group mirror of the finite-group
`TauCeti.Representation.frobeniusSchurIndicator_eq_one_iff` and its companions in
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/CharacterTable/FrobeniusSchur/Trichotomy.lean`, and the statements are
deliberately given the same shape: invariance is the named predicate
`TauCeti.Representation.IsInvariantForm`, which unfolds to `B (π g v) (π g w) = B v w`, and the
`B ≠ 0` clause is left out because nondegeneracy already implies it
(`TauCeti.Representation.IsInvariantForm.nondegenerate_iff_ne_zero`).

## Main statements

* `ContRepresentation.frobeniusSchurIndicator_eq_one_iff`: **the indicator is `1` exactly when the
  representation carries a nondegenerate invariant symmetric form.**
* `ContRepresentation.frobeniusSchurIndicator_eq_neg_one_iff`: **the indicator is `-1` exactly when
  it carries a nondegenerate invariant alternating form.**
* `ContRepresentation.frobeniusSchurIndicator_eq_zero_iff`: **the indicator is `0` exactly when it
  carries no nonzero invariant bilinear form.**

## Implementation notes

The first two theorems are one argument read twice, so both go through the private
`ContRepresentation.finrank_eq_one_iff_exists_nondegenerate`: a count of invariants that is at most
`1` is `1` exactly when a nonzero invariant form of the relevant kind exists, and on an irreducible
representation "nonzero" and "nondegenerate" agree. The third then needs no count of its own: the
trichotomy leaves only the values `1` and `-1` to exclude, and those are exactly what the first two
theorems name.

Over `ℂ` an irreducible representation carries a nonzero invariant symmetric form, a nonzero
invariant alternating one, or no nonzero invariant form at all
(`TauCeti.Representation.exists_isSymm_or_exists_isAlt_or_invariantForms_eq_bot`), so the two
preceding theorems account for every invariant form, and the trichotomy leaves nothing else for the
indicator to be. -/
