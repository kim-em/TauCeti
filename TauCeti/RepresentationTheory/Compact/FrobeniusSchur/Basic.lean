# The Frobenius-Schur indicator of a compact group

For a finite-dimensional continuous representation `π` of a compact group `G`, the
**Frobenius-Schur indicator** is the Haar average of the character over squares,

`ν₂(π) = ∫_G χ_π(g²) dμ`,

with `μ` the normalized Haar measure of `TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Compact/Haar.lean`. It is the
compact-group form of the finite average `|G|⁻¹ ∑_g χ(g²)` built in
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/CharacterTable/FrobeniusSchur/Basic.lean`; the integral replaces the
average and nothing else changes in the statement.

What the indicator computes is the signed difference of the two square characters. Over any field
`χ_{Sym²}(g) - χ_{Λ²}(g) = χ(g²)` (`Representation.char_symmetricSquare_sub_char_exteriorSquare`),
so integrating that identity gives

`ν₂(π) = ∫_G χ_{Sym²π} - ∫_G χ_{Λ²π}`,

and the companion identity `χ(g)² = χ_{Sym²}(g) + χ_{Λ²}(g)` gives the two integrals separately in
terms of `ν₂(π)` and `∫_G χ_π²`. Those two integrals are the (complexified) dimensions of the
invariants of the two squares once the projection onto invariants built from the Haar averaging
operator is available; here only the character-level identities are proved, which is what makes them
independent of that development.

The two square characters are not, a priori, characters of *continuous* representations: the
symmetric and exterior square of a continuous representation carry a continuous action, but that
is not what is used. The closed formulas `χ_{Sym²}(g) = ½(χ(g)² + χ(g²))` and
`χ_{Λ²}(g) = ½(χ(g)² - χ(g²))`, valid because `2 ≠ 0`, exhibit both as continuous functions of `g`
directly, and that is all integration needs; that continuity is
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Continuous/Square/Character.lean`, which needs neither a group nor a
measure, and only the integrability it yields is proved here.

For a **unitary** representation the indicator is real
(`ContRepresentation.conj_frobeniusSchurIndicator`): conjugating the character inverts its
argument, `(g²)⁻¹ = (g⁻¹)²`, and Haar measure on a compact group is inversion invariant. Its
modulus is at most `dim V`. That it takes only the values `1`, `0`, `-1` on an irreducible is the
reality trichotomy, which is not proved here but in
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Compact/FrobeniusSchur/Trichotomy.lean`; the reading of those three
values as invariant bilinear forms is
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Compact/FrobeniusSchur/InvariantForm.lean`.

## Main definitions

* `ContRepresentation.frobeniusSchurIndicator`: `ν₂(π) = ∫_G χ_π(g²) dμ`.

## Main statements

* `ContRepresentation.frobeniusSchurIndicator_eq_of_equiv`: the indicator depends only on the
  equivalence class of the representation.
* `ContRepresentation.frobeniusSchurIndicator_eq_sub_integral`: **the indicator is the
  difference of the two square-character integrals**, `ν₂(π) = ∫ χ_{Sym²π} - ∫ χ_{Λ²π}`.
* `ContRepresentation.integral_character_sq`: the two square-character integrals add up to
  `∫ χ_π²`, so together with the previous statement they determine both:
  `ContRepresentation.integral_character_symmetricPower_two` and
  `ContRepresentation.integral_character_exteriorPower_two` are the resulting closed forms
  `½(∫ χ_π² ± ν₂(π))`.
* `ContRepresentation.conj_frobeniusSchurIndicator` and
  `ContRepresentation.im_frobeniusSchurIndicator`: the indicator of a unitary
  representation is real.
* `ContRepresentation.norm_frobeniusSchurIndicator_le`: it has modulus at most `dim V`.
* `ContRepresentation.frobeniusSchurIndicator_trivial`: the indicator of the trivial
  representation is its dimension, in particular `1` on the line.

## Implementation notes

The continuity hypothesis `hπ : Continuous π` is the one `ContRepresentation.character`
already carries: `ContRepresentation` bundles continuous action *operators* without asking that the
map to them be continuous. Since it is a `Prop` argument, two indicators built from different
continuity proofs are equal by proof irrelevance.

Everything below is declared in the **root** `ContRepresentation` namespace rather than in
`TauCeti.ContRepresentation`, so that `π.frobeniusSchurIndicator hπ` elaborates:
`ContRepresentation` is Mathlib's type, and a namespace for it nested inside `TauCeti` does not
support dot notation.
The ambient `TauCeti` names this file consumes, such as `TauCeti.haarProb` and
`TauCeti.integrable_continuousMap`, are brought in by `open`. The character and its formulas are
methods in `ContRepresentation`.

The scalars are `ℂ`: the symmetric- and exterior-power representations of
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/SymmetricPower.lean` and
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/ExteriorPower.lean`, whose characters the square identities below
speak of, are built over a base ring in `Type`, so a general `RCLike` field in an arbitrary universe
would not even let the statements be formed.

The mathematical development follows Daniel Bump, *Lie Groups*, second edition, Chapter 2, and
Bröcker-tom Dieck, *Representations of Compact Lie Groups*, Chapter II.

/-! ### The two square characters

Over any field the difference of the symmetric-square and exterior-square characters is the
character at the square, and their sum is the square of the character. Integrating both identities
expresses the two square-character integrals through `ν₂(π)` and `∫ χ_π²`. -/

This is the Haar average of `Representation.char_symmetricSquare_sub_char_exteriorSquare`, which
holds over every field, characteristic two included. Once the averaging projection identifies
`∫ χ_ρ` with the dimension of the invariants of `ρ`, the right-hand side becomes the signed count
`dim (Sym²V)ᴳ - dim (Λ²V)ᴳ` of the finite-group statement. -/
