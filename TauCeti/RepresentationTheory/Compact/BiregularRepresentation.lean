# The biregular representation of a compact group on `L²(G)`

A compact group `G` acts on `L²(G)` from both sides, by `TauCeti.leftRegularLp` and
`TauCeti.rightRegularLp`. The two actions commute, and this file bundles them into the **biregular
representation** of `G × G`,

`((g, h) · f) x = f (g⁻¹ * x * h)`.

Bi-translation preserves normalized Haar measure, so the action is unitary. It is also strongly
continuous: the orbit map is continuous at every `L²` function, although for an infinite compact
group the representation need not be continuous in the operator norm. This is the `G × G`-action
used by the equivariant form of the Peter-Weyl decomposition.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.biRegularLp`: the biregular representation of `G × G` on `L²(G)`.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.biRegularLp_apply`: unfolds the action to `Lp.compMeasurePreserving`; the body of
  `biRegularLp` is not exposed, so this is the interface to its raw form.
* `TauCeti.biRegularLp_toLp`: computes the action on continuous representatives.
* `TauCeti.biRegularLp_apply_mk_one` and `TauCeti.biRegularLp_apply_one_mk`: the two factors are
  the left and the right regular representation.
* `TauCeti.biRegularLp_apply_eq_left_right` and `TauCeti.biRegularLp_apply_eq_right_left`: the
  action is the composite of the two translations, in either order.
* `TauCeti.isUnitary_biRegularLp`: the representation is unitary.
* `TauCeti.continuous_biRegularLp_apply`: the action is strongly continuous.
