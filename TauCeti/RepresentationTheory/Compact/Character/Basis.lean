# The irreducible characters are a Hilbert basis of the class functions

Peter-Weyl (`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Compact/PeterWeyl.lean`) makes the normalized matrix
coefficients of a skeleton of the unitary dual a Hilbert basis of `L²(G)`. This file cuts that
basis down to the closed subspace `TauCeti.classFunctionLp` of class functions and finds the
irreducible **characters** there: they are a Hilbert basis of the class functions, the
compact-group form of "the irreducible characters are a basis of the class functions".

## The argument

Fix a finite-dimensional irreducible unitary continuous `π` and a class function `f`. The pairing
`A v w = ⟪(π)_{v,w}, f⟫` is linear in `v` and conjugate linear in `w`, so it is `⟪w, T v⟫` for a
unique endomorphism `T` of the carrier. Conjugation-invariance of `f` says exactly that `A` is
unchanged when both vectors are moved by `π h`
(`TauCeti.ContRepresentation.inner_matrixCoeffLp_map_map`), and that makes `T` an intertwiner.
Schur's lemma over an algebraically closed field collapses `T` to a scalar, so

`⟪(π)_{v,w}, f⟫ = c · ⟪w, v⟫`

(`TauCeti.ContRepresentation.exists_forall_inner_matrixCoeffLp_eq`): a class function sees only
the *trace* direction of each Peter-Weyl block. Taking `v = w` over an orthonormal basis and
summing identifies `c · dim V` with the pairing of `f` against the sum of the diagonal matrix
coefficients, which is the **conjugate** of the character, not the character. Inversion
`g ↦ g⁻¹` exchanges the two (`ContRepresentation.invLpₗᵢ_characterLp`), and it is an
isometry preserving the class functions, so running the argument on the inverse-translate of `f`
is what turns orthogonality to every character into the vanishing of every Peter-Weyl coefficient.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.characterFamily`: the characters of a family of models, as elements of the class
  functions.
* `TauCeti.characterBasis`: **the Hilbert basis of `classFunctionLp` given by the irreducible
  characters**, for a skeleton of the unitary dual.
* `TauCeti.stdCharacterBasis`: the same on the chosen representatives of `TauCeti.IrrepClass`, so
  that no skeleton has to be supplied.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.ContRepresentation.exists_forall_inner_matrixCoeffLp_eq`: against a class function, the
  matrix coefficients of an irreducible pair off into a single scalar.
* `TauCeti.eq_zero_of_forall_inner_characterLp_eq_zero`: **class-function completeness.** A class
  function orthogonal to every irreducible character is zero.
* `TauCeti.coe_characterBasis`, `TauCeti.coe_stdCharacterBasis`: the basis is the characters
  themselves.

## References

The closed subspace of class functions and the membership of the characters in it are developed
in `TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Compact/ClassFunctionLp.lean`. The `[Finite G]` shadow of the
statement is that the irreducible characters of a finite group are a basis of its class functions.
