# Weyl's unitarian trick

Averaging the inner product of a Hilbert space over a compact group turns it into a
`G`-invariant inner product. This file carries out that averaging for a continuous representation
`π` of a compact group. Rather than producing a second
`InnerProductSpace` structure on `V` — which would not make the given `π` unitary for the fixed
instance Lean already has — the averaged form is represented by its Gram operator

`gramOperator π hπ = ∫ g, (π g)† ∘ (π g) ∂(haarProb G)`,

a positive-definite self-adjoint operator satisfying `⟪v, S w⟫ = ∫ g, ⟪π g v, π g w⟫`. Invariance
of the averaged form is then the operator identity `(π g)† ∘ S ∘ (π g) = S`.

## Main definitions

* `ContRepresentation.gramOperator`: the Gram operator of the Haar-averaged inner product.

## Main statements

* `ContRepresentation.inner_gramOperator`: the defining property
  `⟪v, S w⟫ = ∫ g, ⟪π g v, π g w⟫`.
* `ContRepresentation.isSelfAdjoint_gramOperator` and
  `ContRepresentation.isPositive_gramOperator`: the Gram operator is self-adjoint and
  positive.
* `ContRepresentation.re_inner_gramOperator_self_pos`: it is positive *definite*; the
  stronger quantitative bound is
  `ContRepresentation.exists_pos_mul_norm_sq_le_re_inner_gramOperator`,
  which bounds the averaged form below by a positive multiple of the original norm square.
* `ContRepresentation.inner_gramOperator_map_map`: the averaged form is `G`-invariant,
  and `ContRepresentation.adjoint_comp_gramOperator_comp` is its operator form.
* `ContRepresentation.isUnitarizable`: the existence of an invariant positive-definite
  self-adjoint operator.
* `ContRepresentation.gramOperator_eq_one`: for an already unitary representation the
  averaging changes nothing.

This is the compact-group replacement for the invertibility of `|G|` in Maschke's theorem. The
invariant-complement and complete-reducibility results of
`TauCeti.RepresentationTheory.Continuous.InvariantComplement` take `IsUnitary` as a hypothesis; this
file does not discharge that hypothesis, but the invariant form built here is the input a
unitarization construction needs. `TauCeti.RepresentationTheory.Compact.UnitaryModel` carries that
construction out in finite dimensions, conjugating `π` into a representation that is unitary for
the inner product `V` was given.

The mathematical development follows Daniel Bump, *Lie Groups*, second edition, Chapter 2.

/-- The action operators of a continuous representation of a compact group are uniformly
bounded below: there is a `c > 0` with `c * ‖v‖ ≤ ‖π g v‖` for every `g` and `v`.

The bound comes from applying the inverse operator `π g⁻¹`, whose norm is bounded uniformly in `g`
because `G` is compact and `π` is continuous. Only the seminormed-space structure is involved,
so this is stated before the inner product enters. -/

`(π g)† ∘ gramOperator π hπ ∘ (π g) = gramOperator π hπ` that expresses `G`-invariance of the
averaged form. The real scalar action needed for integration is the canonical restriction of the

Nondegeneracy of the averaged form is where compactness of `G` enters a second time: the operator
norms `‖π g‖` are uniformly bounded, so `‖π g v‖` is bounded *below* by a positive multiple of
`‖v‖`, and the average of `‖π g v‖ ^ 2` cannot collapse to zero. -/

This operator is the input to unitarization: retopologizing `V` by `⟪S ·, ·⟫`, or conjugating `π`
by `S ^ (1 / 2)`, makes every `π g` unitary. Neither construction is carried out here, so this file
does not itself produce an `IsUnitary` representation;
`ContRepresentation.exists_isUnitary_congr` does, for a finite-dimensional carrier. -/
