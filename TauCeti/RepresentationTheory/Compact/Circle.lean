# The circle group: Fourier monomials are its finite-dimensional irreducible representations

For a positive period — the standing hypothesis `[Fact (0 < T)]`, which is what Mathlib's
compactness instance and its Fourier analysis on `AddCircle T` both require — the circle
`AddCircle T` is a compact abelian group. This file builds its continuous representations on `ℂ`
from Mathlib's Fourier monomials, shows that they exhaust the *finite-dimensional* irreducible
continuous representations up to equivalence and are pairwise inequivalent, and checks that the
general compact-group theory, specialized to the circle, returns Mathlib's Fourier analysis on the
nose.

Concretely, `fourierRep T n` is the continuous representation of the circle on `ℂ` in which the
group element `x` acts by multiplication by `fourier n x`. It is one-dimensional, hence
irreducible, and unitary because `fourier n x` has modulus one; its character is `fourier n` again.
Under those identifications:

* the `L²` inner product of two of these characters, computed for the normalized Haar measure of
  `TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Compact/Haar.lean`, is Mathlib's `AddCircle.orthonormal_fourier`;
* the general first orthogonality relation `character_orthonormal_self` and the general second
  orthogonality relation `character_orthonormal_distinct` return the diagonal and off-diagonal
  halves of that same statement.

The list `n ↦ fourierRep T n` is moreover complete among the *finite-dimensional* irreducibles. A
representation carried by `ℂ` acts by the scalar `π x 1`, which is a continuous additive character
of `AddCircle T` and therefore a Fourier monomial by `AddChar.exists_fourierAddChar_eq`, so it *is*
a `fourierRep`. A finite-dimensional irreducible one on an arbitrary carrier is only *equivalent*
to a `fourierRep`, its carrier being a line by the dimension count for an irreducible
representation of a commutative group over an algebraically closed field. The index `n` is uniquely
determined, so `ℤ` indexes the finite-dimensional irreducibles exactly once.

The last two are recorded as anonymous `example`s: they are consistency checks on the general
theory's normalization, not new API, and naming them would duplicate
`TauCeti.inner_characterLp_fourierRep`.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.fourierChar`: the `n`-th Fourier monomial as a linear character
  `Multiplicative (AddCircle T) →* ℂˣ` of the circle group.
* `TauCeti.fourierRep`: the `n`-th Fourier monomial as a one-dimensional continuous representation
  of the circle group.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.haarProb_eq_haarAddCircle`: the normalized Haar measure of the circle group is Mathlib's
  `AddCircle.haarAddCircle`.
* `TauCeti.measurePreserving_ofAdd_haarAddCircle`: `Multiplicative.ofAdd` carries
  `AddCircle.haarAddCircle` to that normalized Haar measure.
* `TauCeti.isUnitary_fourierRep`, `TauCeti.isIrreducible_fourierRep`: each `fourierRep T n` is a
  unitary irreducible representation.
* `TauCeti.character_fourierRep`: the character of `fourierRep T n` is `fourier n`.
* `TauCeti.contIntertwiningMap_fourierRep_eq_zero_of_ne`: for `m ≠ n` there is no nonzero
  continuous intertwiner `fourierRep T n → fourierRep T m`, so the Fourier representations are
  pairwise inequivalent.
* `MonoidHom.exists_fourierChar_eq`, `ContRepresentation.exists_fourierRep_eq`: every continuous
  linear character of the circle group, and every continuous representation of it carried by `ℂ`,
  is a Fourier one.
* `TauCeti.nonempty_equiv_fourierRep_iff`: two Fourier representations are equivalent only if they
  are equal.
* `ContRepresentation.exists_nonempty_equiv_fourierRep`,
  `ContRepresentation.existsUnique_nonempty_equiv_fourierRep`: **the classification.** Every
  finite-dimensional irreducible continuous representation of the circle group is equivalent to
  `fourierRep T n` for a unique `n : ℤ`.
* `TauCeti.orthonormal_characterLp_fourierRep`: the characters of the `fourierRep T n` are an
  orthonormal family in `L²` of the circle group for normalized Haar measure; this is
  `AddCircle.orthonormal_fourier` read through the general compact-group packaging.

## Implementation notes

`fourierRep T n` acts by the scalar `fourierChar T n`, so its underlying representation is
`Representation.ofLinearCharacter (fourierChar T n)`
(`TauCeti.toRepresentation_fourierRep`); irreducibility and the character are then the
corresponding facts about a linear character, not fresh one-dimensional computations.

`ContRepresentation` is stated for a multiplicative monoid, while `AddCircle T` is additive, so the
group here is `Multiplicative (AddCircle T)`. The measure-theoretic instances that makes that type
usable as a compact group with Haar measure are in
`TauCeti/MeasureTheory/Group/TypeTags.lean`; they are definitional, so
`haarProb_eq_haarAddCircle` is just the uniqueness of a Haar probability measure applied on the
multiplicative side. Because `Multiplicative (AddCircle T)` and `AddCircle T` are the same type
with the same topology and σ-algebra, an integral over one is literally an integral over the other,
which is what lets `inner_characterLp_fourierRep` end in Mathlib's orthonormality statement.

The two exhaustion statements are deliberately different in kind. On the carrier `ℂ` the Fourier
representation is recovered on the nose, as an equality of representations
(`ContRepresentation.exists_fourierRep_eq`); on an arbitrary carrier no equality is available, and
`ContRepresentation.exists_nonempty_equiv_fourierRep` produces a `ContRepresentation.Equiv`
instead. The passage between them is `ContinuousLinearEquiv.congr`, the transport of a
representation along a continuous linear equivalence of carriers. What is *not* done here is the
full Peter-Weyl identification of `peterWeylBasis` with `AddCircle.fourierBasis` under the indexing
equivalence `Σ π, Fin 1 × Fin 1 ≃ ℤ`.

The general compact-group character theory that is specialized here is in
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Compact/Character/Basic.lean`. The mathematical development follows
Daniel Bump, *Lie Groups*, second edition, Chapter 2.
