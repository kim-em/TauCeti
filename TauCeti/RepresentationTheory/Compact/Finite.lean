# Finite groups: normalized Haar, the `L²` pairing, and orthogonality

A finite group carrying the discrete topology is a compact topological group, so the whole
compact-group development applies to it. This file identifies the objects it produces with the
elementary finite-group ones: normalized Haar measure is `|G|⁻¹ • Measure.count`, the Haar integral
is the group average `|G|⁻¹ ∑ g, F g`, and the Haar average of the action operators of a
representation is the finite group average `|G|⁻¹ ∑ g, π g`, the Reynolds operator. (Mathlib's
algebraic counterpart of that operator is `Representation.averageMap`; this file does not connect
to it, only to the explicit sum.)

Everything the compact theory phrases as an `L²(G)` inner product then becomes a finite Hermitian
sum. Normalized Haar measure has full support on a discrete space and every function on a discrete
space is continuous, so a class in `Lp 𝕜 p (haarProb G)` *is* a function on `G` — the coercion is a
linear equivalence `Lp 𝕜 p (haarProb G) ≃ₗ[𝕜] (G → 𝕜)`, for any exponent — and at `p = 2` the inner
product is `|G|⁻¹ ∑ x, conj (f x) · g x`. Rewriting the compact statements along that identity turns
the two Schur orthogonality relations, and both branches — diagonal and off-diagonal — of the first
(row) character orthogonality relation, into their classical finite-group forms, and turns the
intertwiner count
`∫ g, χ_π(g⁻¹) · χ_ρ(g) ∂haarProb G = dim Hom_G(V, W)` into
`|G|⁻¹ ∑ g, χ_π(g⁻¹) · χ_ρ(g) = dim Hom_G(V, W)`, which is the shape Mathlib proves algebraically as
`Representation.card_inv_mul_sum_char_mul_char_eq_finrank`. (For a unitary `π` that Haar integral is
the `L²` inner product `⟪χ_π, χ_ρ⟫`, but no unitarity is needed for the count.) Each such
specialization carries the name of the compact statement it specializes, with the suffix `_sum`
recording that the Haar integral has become a group average.

The measure statement is proved without appealing to the Haar property of the counting measure, and
in fact without any topology: left invariance alone forces all singletons of a finite group to have
the same measure `c`, so a left-invariant probability measure is `c • Measure.count` by
`MeasureTheory.Measure.ext_of_singleton`, and evaluating both sides on `Set.univ` computes
`c = |G|⁻¹` from the total mass being `1`.

Everything downstream then follows by rewriting: `MeasureTheory.integral_fintype` turns a Bochner
integral against a measure on a finite space into the sum of its singleton weights, which the
measure computation has just identified.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.eq_smul_count_of_isMulLeftInvariant`: **a left-invariant probability measure on a finite
  group is the normalized counting measure** `|G|⁻¹ • Measure.count`. Since normalized Haar measure
  is one, `TauCeti.haarProb_eq_smul_count` is the special case that identifies it, and it also says
  that no other Haar probability measure exists; `TauCeti.haarProb_singleton` and
  `TauCeti.haarProb_apply` read off the measure of a singleton and of an arbitrary set.
* `TauCeti.haarProb_eq_uniformOn_univ`: it is Mathlib's uniform probability measure
  `ProbabilityTheory.uniformOn Set.univ`.
* `TauCeti.integral_haarProb`: **the Haar integral is the group average** `|G|⁻¹ • ∑ g, F g`, with
  `TauCeti.integral_haarProb_eq_inv_mul_sum` its `𝕜`-scalar form; `TauCeti.haarAverage_eq_smul_sum`
  says the same for the bundled averaging operator.
* `ContRepresentation.haarAverageMap_eq_smul_sum`: the Haar average of the action operators is the
  finite average `|G|⁻¹ • ∑ g, π g v`.
* `TauCeti.ae_haarProb_eq_top`: **normalized Haar measure on a finite discrete group has full
  support**, so its almost-everywhere filter is `⊤` and, by `TauCeti.eq_of_ae_eq_haarProb`, two
  functions agreeing almost everywhere agree everywhere. This is what makes an `L²` class on a
  finite group a genuine function; `TauCeti.coeFn_toLp_haarProb` is the case of it used throughout,
  that the class of a continuous function is that function.
* `TauCeti.lpHaarProbEquivFun`: **`L²(G)` is `G → 𝕜`**, by the linear equivalence taking an `Lp`
  class to its values; the previous item is its injectivity and finiteness is its surjectivity.
  Nothing in it depends on the exponent, so it is stated for every `p`.
* `TauCeti.finiteDimensional_lp_haarProb` and `TauCeti.finrank_lp_haarProb`: **`Lp` of a finite
  discrete group is finite-dimensional, of dimension `|G|`**, being that space of functions.
* `TauCeti.inner_Lp_haarProb_eq_inv_mul_sum`: **the `L²(G)` inner product is the normalized
  Hermitian pairing** `|G|⁻¹ ∑ x, conj (f x) · g x` of those values, with
  `TauCeti.inner_toLp_haarProb_eq_inv_mul_sum` the form for two continuous functions.
* `ContRepresentation.schur_orthogonality_self_sum`,
  `ContRepresentation.schur_orthogonality_distinct_sum` and
  `ContRepresentation.schur_orthogonality_sum`: **the two Schur orthogonality relations as finite
  averages** of matrix coefficients, the middle one at the vanishing-intertwiner hypothesis of the
  compact theory and the last at a pair of inequivalent irreducibles, with
  `ContRepresentation.schur_orthogonality_basis_sum` the Kronecker-delta form of the first in an
  orthonormal basis.
* `ContRepresentation.character_orthonormal_distinct_sum`: **the off-diagonal branch of the first
  (row) character orthogonality relation as a finite average**. (The column sum over the irreducible
  characters, the second orthogonality relation, is not treated here.)
* `ContRepresentation.inner_gramOperator_eq_inv_mul_sum`: **the invariant form the unitarian trick
  averages into existence is the finite average** `|G|⁻¹ ∑ g, ⟪π g v, π g w⟫`, with
  `ContRepresentation.gramOperator_eq_smul_sum` the same identity at the level of the operator
  representing it and `ContRepresentation.inner_gramOperator_self_eq_inv_mul_sum` its diagonal.
* `ContRepresentation.exists_isUnitary_congr_of_finite`: **the unitarian trick for a finite group**,
  every finite-dimensional representation being conjugate to a unitary one.
* `ContRepresentation.exists_orthogonal_irreducible_decomposition_of_finite`: **Maschke's theorem in
  orthogonal form**, the finite shadow of complete reducibility: `π` itself is an internal direct
  sum of irreducible subrepresentations, orthogonal for the averaged inner product.

The counting identity `|G|⁻¹ ∑ g, χ_π g = dim V^G` that the compact-group character integral
generalizes then costs one rewrite. It is not given a name: Mathlib already proves it, as
`Representation.card_inv_mul_sum_char_eq_finrank`, and that lemma closes the `ContRepresentation`
statement outright, so only the route through the compact theory is new. The intertwiner count
`|G|⁻¹ ∑ g, χ_π(g⁻¹) · χ_ρ(g) = dim Hom_G(V, W)` is unnamed for the same reason: Mathlib proves it
as `Representation.card_inv_mul_sum_char_mul_char_eq_finrank`, for the algebraic intertwiner space
`Representation.IntertwiningMap`, which in finite dimensions is the continuous one because every
linear map out of a finite-dimensional normed space is continuous. Both routes are exhibited by
anonymous `example`s, as are both branches of Mathlib's `Representation.char_orthonormal`: the
diagonal one is `ContRepresentation.character_orthonormal_self` read through the finite
pairing — Mathlib and `TauCeti.ClassFunction.characterPairing_ofCharacter_self` both already prove
that identity, so no name is claimed for it either — and the off-diagonal one is
`character_orthonormal_distinct_sum` with its intertwiner hypothesis discharged, for a pair of
inequivalent irreducibles, by the vanishing half of Schur's lemma.

## Implementation notes

Finiteness is spelled `[Finite G]` wherever that suffices — the measure-theoretic statements and the
equivalence `TauCeti.lpHaarProbEquivFun` — and `[Fintype G]` only where a sum over `Finset.univ`
appears in the statement itself, since a `Fintype` instance recovered from `Finite` inside a proof
would not be the one indexing that sum. The scalars and the exponent are weakened the same way:
`TauCeti.lpHaarProbEquivFun` needs only `[NontriviallyNormedField 𝕜]` and an arbitrary exponent —
not even `[Fact (1 ≤ p)]`, since `MeasureTheory.MemLp.of_discrete` produces the class of a function
at every exponent, whereas `ContinuousMap.toLp`, being a continuous linear map, needs a norm on
`Lp` and hence that hypothesis — and `[RCLike 𝕜]` and `p = 2` appear from the inner-product
statements on.
Cardinalities are written `Nat.card G` throughout;
`Nat.card_eq_fintype_card` converts.

`IsTopologicalGroup G`, `CompactSpace G`, `T2Space G` and `MeasurableSingletonClass G` are all
found by instance search from `[DiscreteTopology G]`, `[Finite G]` and `[BorelSpace G]`, so no
extra hypotheses are carried. Continuity of a representation is likewise automatic, by
`continuous_of_discreteTopology`, and is asked of the caller only where the *statement* needs it:
the two pairing lemmas are about the `L²` classes `matrixCoeffLp π hπ` and `characterLp π hπ`, which
take the continuity proof as an argument, so a caller of them holds one already. The orthogonality
relations ask for none: the Schur ones are stated as bare sums `∑ g, ⟪π g v, w⟫ · …`, and the
character one uses Mathlib's `Representation.character`, which is by
`ContRepresentation.coe_character` the function underlying `character π hπ`. Those
statements mention no measure either, so they ask for no measurable structure on `G`: their proofs
install `borel G` themselves, and the caller is left with a bare finite discrete group. The two
Maschke statements go one step further: mentioning no topology on `G` at all, they have their proof
install the discrete topology as well, and the caller is left with a bare finite group.

The scalar in the averaged sums is real, not `𝕜`: the Bochner integral being specialized is an
`ℝ`-integral, and `V` is not assumed to be an `ℝ`-`𝕜`-scalar tower. The conversion is confined to
`TauCeti.integral_haarProb_eq_inv_mul_sum`, whose integrand is `𝕜`-valued and which uses
`RCLike.real_smul_eq_coe_mul`; the character count then goes through that lemma.

## References

Each statement below is the finite case of the compact-group theorem named beside it.
`haarProb G` is the normalized counting measure `|G|⁻¹ • count`, and the counting identity
`dim V^G = |G|⁻¹ ∑ g, χ_π g` is the finite shadow of
`ContRepresentation.integral_character_eq_finrank_invariants`, matching Mathlib's
`FDRep.average_char_eq_finrank_invariants` for the purely algebraic theory. `L²(G)` is `G → 𝕜` by
`TauCeti.lpHaarProbEquivFun` and `⟪·, ·⟫_{L²(G)}` becomes the finite Hermitian pairing on it,
`schur_orthogonality_self`, `schur_orthogonality_distinct` and
`schur_orthogonality` become the classical orthogonality relations for matrix coefficients, and
`character_orthonormal_self` and `character_orthonormal_distinct` become the two branches of
Mathlib's `Representation.char_orthonormal`, exhibited by two anonymous `example`s. Finally
`exists_orthogonal_irreducible_decomposition` specializes, through the finite unitarian trick, to
`ContRepresentation.exists_orthogonal_irreducible_decomposition_of_finite`, whose blocks are
subrepresentations of the given representation, carried back along the unitarizing equivalence
`ContRepresentation.congrEquiv`. What that specialization adds to Mathlib's Maschke is the
orthogonality of the summands, which needs the inner product Mathlib's complements do not see; the
purely algebraic conclusion, that `π.toRepresentation.asModule` is a semisimple
`MonoidAlgebra 𝕜 G`-module whenever `|G|` is invertible in `𝕜`, is Mathlib's own instance and is
neither restated nor reproved here. Peter-Weyl for a finite group, that `peterWeylBasis` is the
matrix-coefficient basis of the functions on `G`, is proved in
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Compact/DegreeSum.lean`, on top of the identification
`TauCeti.lpHaarProbEquivFun` built below.

the characters of two inequivalent irreducibles have vanishing group average. This is

is discharged by the vanishing half of Schur's lemma,
`ContRepresentation.eq_zero_of_isEmpty_equiv`, exactly as `orthonormal_characterLp`
discharges it in the compact theory. So the substantive vanishing statement is reached, not
assumed: `character_orthonormal_distinct_sum` keeps the hypothesis of the compact theorem
`character_orthonormal_distinct` it specializes, and irreducibility enters here.

group is compact and every representation of it is continuous by `continuous_of_discreteTopology` —

/-- **Maschke's theorem in orthogonal form.** A finite-dimensional representation `π` of a finite
group on an inner product space is an internal direct sum of finitely many irreducible
subrepresentations, of dimensions adding up to `dim V`, which are moreover pairwise *orthogonal*
for an invariant inner product `⟪e ·, e ·⟫` obtained from the given one by a continuous linear
automorphism `e` of the carrier.

This is the finite shadow of complete reducibility, and all that is finite about it is the
production of `e`: unitarity is not assumed but produced, by the finite unitarian trick
`ContRepresentation.exists_isUnitary_congr_of_finite`, and the decomposition of `π` itself is then
`ContRepresentation.IsUnitary.exists_orthogonal_irreducible_decomposition_of_congr`, which
decomposes the unitary model and carries every block back along the equivalence of representations
`ContRepresentation.congrEquiv : π.Equiv (congr e π)` for an arbitrary group. The blocks are
therefore subrepresentations of `π` itself.

Distorting the inner product by `e` is unavoidable and is what "Maschke" costs here: Lean fixes one
inner product on `V`, and a representation of a finite group need not preserve it, only the average
`|G|⁻¹ ∑ g, ⟪π g ·, π g ·⟫` of its translates. So the blocks need not be orthogonal for `⟪·, ·⟫`,
and orthogonality is stated for the invariant form `⟪e ·, e ·⟫` that the unitarian trick produces —
equivalently, their images under `e` are the orthogonal family decomposing the unitary model
`congr e π`. It is that orthogonality which the compact theory contributes over Mathlib's Maschke,
which produces complements but no inner product; the plain semisimplicity is not restated here,
being already a Mathlib instance for every field in which `|G|` is invertible. -/
