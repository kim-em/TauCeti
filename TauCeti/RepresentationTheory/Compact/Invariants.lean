# Haar averaging projects onto the invariants, and the character integral counts them

For a finite group `G` whose order is invertible in the scalars, Mathlib averages the action
operators of a representation over the group and gets a projection onto the invariant subspace
(`Representation.averageMap`, `Representation.isProj_averageMap`). This file is the compact-group
form of that construction: the finite average is replaced by the Haar integral

`haarAverageMap π hπ = ∫ g, π g ∂(haarProb G)`,

the integrated operator of the constant function `1`, and normalized Haar measure plays the role of
the factor `1/|G|` — it is what makes the average of a constant that constant, so that the operator
restricts to the identity on the invariants.

The two invariance properties of the average are the two translation invariances of Haar measure:
left invariance gives `π h ∘ P = P`, and right invariance — unimodularity, automatic on a compact
group — gives `P ∘ π h = P`. Together they make `P` a self-intertwiner whose image is exactly the
invariant subspace `ContRepresentation.invariants`, and `P` is idempotent because it fixes that
image pointwise.

In finite dimension the trace of a projection is the dimension of its image, and the trace of the
integrated operator is the Haar integral of the character
(`TauCeti.ContRepresentation.trace_integratedOperator`). The two readings of the same trace give the
counting theorem

`dim V^G = ∫ g, χ_π g ∂(haarProb G)`,

the compact form of the finite-group identity `dim V^G = |G|⁻¹ ∑ χ_π g`. It is the tool that turns
character integrals into dimensions: applied to the symmetric and exterior squares it computes the
Frobenius-Schur indicator, and applied to `Hom(V, W)` it computes the dimension of the space of
intertwiners `V → W` (which for complex scalars and irreducible `V` is the multiplicity of `V` in
`W`, but over `ℝ` counts each copy with the dimension of its endomorphism division algebra).

## Main definitions

* `ContRepresentation.haarAverageMap`: the Haar average `∫ g, π g` of the action operators.

## Main results

* `ContRepresentation.isProj_haarAverageMap`: the Haar average is a projection onto the
  invariant subspace, with `ContRepresentation.range_haarAverageMap` identifying its range
  and `ContRepresentation.haarAverageMap_comp_self` its idempotence.
* `ContRepresentation.trace_haarAverageMap`: its trace is `∫ g, χ_π g`.
* `ContRepresentation.integral_character_eq_finrank_invariants`: **the Haar integral of the
  character is the dimension of the invariants.**
* `ContRepresentation.integral_character_eq_zero_iff`: that integral vanishes exactly when
  there is no nonzero invariant vector.

## Implementation notes

`haarAverageMap` is defined as `integratedOperator π hπ 1` rather than as a fresh Haar average, so
that the trace computation is the one already proved for the integrated operator and no second
Bochner-integral bookkeeping is needed. Its two invariance lemmas are proved vectorwise from
`TauCeti.haarAverage_comp_mulLeft` and `TauCeti.haarAverage_comp_mulRight`, applied to the orbit
map `g ↦ π g v`, and not from the class-function machinery of
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Compact/Integrated.lean`: the constant function `1` is a class
function, but that route yields only conjugation invariance, which is strictly weaker than the
one-sided invariance used here.

The invariant subspace is Mathlib's `ContRepresentation.invariants`, not a new definition, and the
projection is packaged through Mathlib's `LinearMap.IsProj` so that `LinearMap.IsProj.trace`
applies verbatim.

The declarations here live in the root `ContRepresentation` namespace, so that `π.haarAverageMap hπ`
elaborates, rather than in `TauCeti.ContRepresentation` alongside the integrated operator they are
built from; the older namespace is opened to reach that operator. The character and its formulas
are methods in `ContRepresentation`.

## References

This projection is the trivial-isotypic case of the character-weighted projections in
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Compact/Character/Projection.lean`. Its multiplicity count is used
for the Frobenius-Schur indicator `∫ g, χ_π (g * g)`, whose trichotomy reads that integral as
the difference of the dimensions of the invariants of the symmetric and exterior squares. The
mathematical development follows Daniel Bump, *Lie Groups*, second edition, Chapter 2, and
T. Bröcker and T. tom Dieck, *Representations of Compact Lie Groups*, Springer GTM 98 (1985),
Chapter II.

/-! ### The two invariances

Left invariance of Haar measure makes the average absorb the action on the left, right invariance
— unimodularity, which a compact group has — makes it absorb the action on the right. Both are read
off `TauCeti.haarAverage_comp_mulLeft` and `TauCeti.haarAverage_comp_mulRight`, once the two
translates of the orbit map are identified. -/
