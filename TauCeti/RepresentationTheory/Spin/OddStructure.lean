# The structure theorem for an odd-dimensional Clifford algebra

Over a separably closed field of characteristic not two, the Clifford algebra of a nondegenerate
quadratic form on a space of dimension `2 * l + 1` is a **product of two matrix algebras**,

`CliffordAlgebra Q ≃ₐ[F] M_{2^l}(F) × M_{2^l}(F)`.

Two results already in place bracket this statement, and the file supplies what joins them. The
volume element of an orthogonal basis of odd length is central, odd, and squares to a nonzero
scalar, so after rescaling it splits the algebra as two copies of its even subalgebra
(`CliffordAlgebra.nonempty_algEquiv_even_prod_of_odd_finrank`); and the Fock action of a
polarization is onto the endomorphism algebra of the spinor module `S = ⋀·W`
(`TauCeti.spinAction_surjective`), which in dimension `2 * l + 1` has dimension `2 ^ l`. What was
missing was the identification of the even subalgebra itself with `M_{2^l}(F)`, and that is the
substance here.

The argument avoids reducing an odd-dimensional form to an even-dimensional one. Write
`A = even Q`, so that the splitting is a surjection `A × A ↠ M_{2^l}(F)` obtained by following it
with the Fock action. The image of `(1, 0)` is a central idempotent of a simple ring, hence `0` or
`1` (`TauCeti.centralIdempotents_eq_pair`), and in either case one of the two coordinate maps
`a ↦ φ (a, 0)`, `a ↦ φ (0, a)` is already a surjective algebra map `A →ₐ[F] M_{2^l}(F)`: that is
`AlgHom.exists_algHom_surjective_of_prod`. A dimension count closes it. The even subalgebra has
half the dimension of the whole (`CliffordAlgebra.finrank_even`), so
`dim A = 2 ^ (2 * l + 1 - 1) = 2 ^ l · 2 ^ l` is the dimension of the target and the surjection is
injective as well.

The splitting itself is general Clifford-algebra theory and lives with the rest of it, in
`TauCeti/LinearAlgebra/CliffordAlgebra/OddSplitting.lean`.

The isomorphisms are not canonical — they depend on a choice of orthogonal basis, of polarization,
and of a basis of the spinor module — so the statements are `Nonempty`, as the even-dimensional
`CliffordAlgebra.nonempty_algEquiv_matrix_of_finrank_eq_two_mul` is.

Once a polarization *is* fixed there is a canonical isomorphism to be had, and the last section
records it. Only the basis of the spinor module was arbitrary above, so dropping it leaves the
Fock action itself: `TauCeti.evenSpinAction` is a bijection from `even Q` onto
`Module.End F (⋀·W)`. That needs neither the matrix identification nor a separably closed field.
The whole Fock action is onto (`TauCeti.spinAction_surjective`), and in odd dimension the even
half already reaches as far: the volume element `ω` is central, so its image commutes with all of
`Module.End F (⋀·W)` and is a scalar, and `ω` is odd with `ω² = c ≠ 0`, so each generator is
`ι v = c⁻¹ (ι v * ω) * ω` with `ι v * ω` even. A dimension count then makes the surjection
injective. That statement, `TauCeti.SpinPolarizationData.evenCliffordEquivEnd`, is the
odd-dimensional companion of the even `TauCeti.SpinPolarizationData.cliffordEquivEnd`, one grade
down: in even dimension the *whole* Clifford algebra is `Module.End F (⋀·W)`, in odd dimension
only its even half is, the whole algebra being two copies of that half.

## Main results

* `CliffordAlgebra.nonempty_algEquiv_even_matrix_of_finrank_eq_two_mul_add_one`: **the even
  subalgebra is a matrix algebra** `M_{2^l}(F)` in dimension `2 * l + 1`.
* `CliffordAlgebra.nonempty_algEquiv_matrix_prod_of_finrank_eq_two_mul_add_one`: **the structure
  theorem in odd dimension**, `CliffordAlgebra Q ≃ₐ[F] M_{2^l}(F) × M_{2^l}(F)`.
* `TauCeti.evenSpinAction_surjective` and `TauCeti.SpinPolarizationData.evenCliffordEquivEnd`:
  **the odd structure theorem in operator form**, that the Fock action identifies `even Q` with
  `Module.End F (⋀·W)`, over any field of characteristic not two.
* `TauCeti.SpinPolarizationData.finrank_exteriorAlgebra_W_of_finrank_eq_two_mul_add_one` and
  `TauCeti.SpinPolarizationData.finrank_even_eq_finrank_end_of_odd_finrank`: the dimension
  bookkeeping the operator form rests on.

/-! ### The odd structure theorem in operator form

The matrix identification above is not canonical: it depends on a basis of the spinor module. The
Fock action itself is canonical once a polarization is chosen, and it identifies the even
subalgebra with the operator algebra of the spinor module directly, over any field of
characteristic not two: the polarization data carries the nondegeneracy, and the volume element
does the rest without being normalized to a square root of one. -/

/-- **The even Clifford action on the spinor module is onto in odd dimension.** The whole Fock
action is onto by `TauCeti.spinAction_surjective`, and in odd dimension the even half already
reaches everything the odd half does: the volume element `ω` of an orthogonal basis is central,
odd, and squares to a nonzero scalar, so its image is a scalar operator, and every generator
factors as `ι v = c⁻¹ (ι v * ω) * ω` with `ι v * ω` even.

This is the sharp form of the odd-dimensional structure theorem: unlike the whole Clifford
algebra, which needs both spinor modules to act faithfully, the even subalgebra already sees all
of `Module.End F (⋀·W)`. Neither nondegeneracy nor a separably closed field is assumed: the
polarization data carries the first (`TauCeti.SpinPolarizationData.nondegenerate`) and the
argument never normalizes `ω`, which is what the second was for. -/
