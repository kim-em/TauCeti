# Invariant subspaces and intertwiners for the spinor and half-spin actions

The Fock model makes the exterior algebra `S = ⋀·W` of the isotropic summand of a polarization a
module over `CliffordAlgebra Q` (`TauCeti.spinAction`), and that action is onto the full
endomorphism algebra as soon as `W` is finite free (`TauCeti.spinAction_surjective`). A module on
which every endomorphism is realized has no proper nonzero submodule at all, so **the spinor module
is simple**, in every dimension and without any nondegeneracy hypothesis: this is
`TauCeti.exists_spinAction_eq`, that a nonzero spinor is carried to every other one, and
`TauCeti.eq_bot_or_eq_top_of_map_spinAction_le`, its lattice form.

That is not yet the irreducibility the spin representation is named for, because in even dimension
`S` visibly splits, into the two half-spin summands `S⁺` and `S⁻` of `TauCeti.spinPlus` and
`TauCeti.spinMinus`. The splitting is invariant not under the whole Clifford algebra but under its
even subalgebra, and the theorem the splitting deserves is that the even subalgebra sees exactly
those two pieces and nothing finer:

`TauCeti.SpinPolarizationData.evenCliffordEquivProdEnd :`
`  even Q ≃ₐ[K] Module.End K S⁺ × Module.End K S⁻`.

The proof of that structure theorem does not count dimensions a second time. Surjectivity onto the
*product* comes from the full structure theorem `TauCeti.spinAction_bijective` together with the
parity bookkeeping of `TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Spin/HalfSpin/Basic.lean`. This file records its
representation-theoretic consequences: each half-spin summand has no proper nonzero invariant
subspace because its factor is a full endomorphism algebra, and the two even-Clifford actions are
**inequivalent**
(`TauCeti.not_exists_equiv_intertwines_spinPlusAction_spinMinusAction`) because the
element of `even Q` acting as the identity on `S⁺` and as zero on `S⁻` kills any map that
intertwines them.

The invariant-subspace conclusions for the even Clifford algebra are stated in lattice form, as
"an invariant subspace is `⊥` or everything", rather than as `IsSimpleModule`: `S⁺` and `S⁻`
carry no `Module (even Q)` instance, and manufacturing one would mean a type synonym for a
statement that reads no better through it. Over a separably closed field, the Spin group linearly
spans the even Clifford algebra when the quadratic form is nondegenerate and the characteristic
is not two. The same dichotomies therefore prove that the even half-spin subrepresentation is
irreducible, that the odd half is irreducible when `P.W ≠ ⊥`, and that the two are inequivalent.

The actions themselves — `TauCeti.spinPlusAction`, `TauCeti.spinMinusAction` and their pair
`TauCeti.evenSpinActionProd` — are defined in
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Spin/HalfSpin/Basic.lean`, beside the bundling of the same two
summands as subrepresentations of `spinRep` that the same invariance gives; this file only proves
theorems about them.

The hypothesis `P.line = ⊥` is the even-dimensional case, and it is exactly what makes the parity
splitting a splitting of modules at all;
`TauCeti.SpinPolarizationData.even_finrank_of_line_eq_bot` turns it into the evenness the structure
theorem is stated with, so no separate parity hypothesis is carried. The lattice dichotomy for
`S⁻` needs no further hypothesis, since it also holds vacuously when `S⁻ = 0`. To conclude that
`S⁻` is simple, combine it with `TauCeti.nontrivial_spinMinus`, whose hypothesis `W ≠ ⊥` rules out
only the zero-dimensional quadratic space: there `S = K` is entirely even and `S⁻` is zero. `S⁺`
always contains the scalars, so it needs no such hypothesis, and neither does the inequivalence.

The odd-dimensional case is the opposite of all this, and the last section records it. There the
even subalgebra is a *single* block rather than a product, so the Fock action already carries it
onto all of `Module.End K S` (`TauCeti.evenSpinAction_surjective`), and the whole spinor module —
not a half of it — is the irreducible object: `TauCeti.spinRep_isIrreducible_of_odd`.
As soon as `P.W ≠ ⊥`, exterior parity still splits `S` as a vector space but no longer as a
representation, which `TauCeti.not_forall_map_spinRep_spinPlus_le` and
`TauCeti.not_forall_map_spinRep_spinMinus_le` record: neither half is `⊥` or everything, so
irreducibility alone forbids either from being invariant. The `P.line = ⊥` carried by every
statement of the even-dimensional half is precisely what fails. Dimension one is the exception:
there `W = ⊥` and `S = K` is entirely even, so `S⁺ = S` and `S⁻ = 0` are both invariant, for want
of anything to split.

The two parities are separated by exactly one hypothesis, the surjectivity of
`TauCeti.evenSpinAction`, and `TauCeti.isIrreducible_spinRep_of_span_of_surjective` is stated
against it rather than against a dimension, so the dichotomy is visible in the statement. It fails
in even dimension except for the zero-dimensional quadratic space, where `S = K` is
one-dimensional and there is no room for it to fail.

What is not proved here is the odd-dimensional splitting of `CliffordAlgebra Q` into its two
central summands, for which the results here are the even-dimensional half; it is
`CliffordAlgebra.nonempty_algEquiv_matrix_prod_of_finrank_eq_two_mul_add_one`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.exists_spinAction_eq` and `TauCeti.eq_bot_or_eq_top_of_map_spinAction_le`: **the spinor
  module is a simple Clifford module.**
* `TauCeti.mem_even_of_map_spinPlus_le_of_map_spinMinus_le`: a Clifford element whose action
  preserves both half-spin summands is even.
* `TauCeti.eq_bot_or_eq_top_of_map_spinPlusAction_le` and
  `TauCeti.eq_bot_or_eq_top_of_map_spinMinusAction_le`: the two half-spin summands have no proper
  nonzero invariant subspace. Together with `TauCeti.nontrivial_spinPlus` and
  `TauCeti.nontrivial_spinMinus`, respectively, these say that the summands are simple.
* `TauCeti.eq_zero_of_intertwines_spinPlusAction_spinMinusAction` and
  `TauCeti.eq_zero_of_intertwines_spinMinusAction_spinPlusAction`: there is no nonzero map either
  way intertwining the two actions, and hence
  `TauCeti.not_exists_equiv_intertwines_spinPlusAction_spinMinusAction`: **the half-spin summands
  are inequivalent.**
* `TauCeti.isIrreducible_spinPlusSubrep_of_span` and
  `TauCeti.isIrreducible_spinMinusSubrep_of_span`: **the two half-spin group representations are
  irreducible** when the Spin group spans the even Clifford algebra, with `P.W ≠ ⊥` required for
  the odd half. The `_of_isSquare` and suffix-free versions give progressively stronger sufficient
  hypotheses.
* `TauCeti.isEmpty_equiv_spinPlusSubrep_spinMinusSubrep_of_span`: **the two half-spin group
  representations are inequivalent** under the same spanning hypothesis, with analogous
  corollaries.
* `TauCeti.isIrreducible_spinRep_of_span_of_surjective`: the spin representation is irreducible
  once the Spin group spans the even subalgebra and that subalgebra exhausts the endomorphisms of
  the spinor module.
* `TauCeti.isIrreducible_spinRep_of_isSquare` and `TauCeti.spinRep_isIrreducible_of_odd`: **the
  spin representation is irreducible in odd dimension**, the type `Bₗ` half of Layer 4, under the
  square normalization and over a separably closed field respectively.
* `TauCeti.not_forall_map_spinRep_spinPlus_le_of_isIrreducible` and
  `TauCeti.not_forall_map_spinRep_spinMinus_le_of_isIrreducible`: **an irreducible spinor module
  does not split along exterior parity**, provided `P.W ≠ ⊥`, which rules out only dimension one;
  `TauCeti.not_forall_map_spinRep_spinPlus_le` and
  `TauCeti.not_forall_map_spinRep_spinMinus_le` are their odd-dimensional specializations.

/-- **The whole spin representation is irreducible** as soon as the Spin group linearly spans the
even Clifford subalgebra and that subalgebra already exhausts the endomorphisms of the spinor
module.

The second hypothesis is exactly what separates the two parities of `finrank K V`. In *positive*
even dimension it fails — the even subalgebra is the *product* of the two half-spin endomorphism
algebras, by `TauCeti.SpinPolarizationData.evenCliffordEquivProdEnd`, and `S` visibly splits — and
in odd dimension it holds, by `TauCeti.evenSpinAction_surjective`. Dimension zero is the exception
on the even side: there `W = ⊥`, the odd block is zero, `S = K` is one-dimensional and the even
subalgebra is already all of `Module.End K S`. -/

/-- **An irreducible spinor module does not split along exterior parity.** The even part `S⁺` is
not invariant under the Spin group, so it is not a subrepresentation of `spinRep`.

Nothing about the anisotropic remainder is computed: the proof is by irreducibility, `S⁺` being
neither `⊥` (it contains the scalars) nor everything (it misses the nonzero `S⁻`). The hypothesis
`P.W ≠ ⊥` is what excludes `finrank K V = 1`, where `S = K` is entirely even, `S⁺ = S` is trivially
invariant and there is nothing to split. In even dimension the same subspace *is* invariant, by
`TauCeti.spinPlus_invariant`, and `spinRep` is correspondingly reducible. -/

This is the generality of the even-dimensional `TauCeti.isIrreducible_spinPlusSubrep_of_isSquare`:
no separably closed field, and no nondegeneracy hypothesis, the polarization data already carrying
it by `TauCeti.SpinPolarizationData.nondegenerate`. The square normalization is only what lifts a
product of two reflections to the Spin group, and it is the sole remaining hypothesis of this
argument. -/

/-- **The spin representation is irreducible in odd dimension.** For a polarized quadratic space of
dimension `2 * l + 1` over a separably closed field of characteristic not two, the Spin group acts
irreducibly on the whole spinor module `S = ⋀·W`.

This is the type `Bₗ` half of the Layer-4 irreducibility statement, in the shape the roadmap pins.
Nondegeneracy of `Q` is not assumed: the polarization data already carries it, by
`TauCeti.SpinPolarizationData.nondegenerate`. Except in dimension one, where `W = ⊥` and `S = K` is
entirely even, the exterior parity splitting `S = S⁺ ⊕ S⁻` is *not* a splitting of representations
here: see `TauCeti.not_forall_map_spinRep_spinPlus_le`. The even-dimensional counterpart is the
pair `TauCeti.isIrreducible_spinPlusSubrep`, `TauCeti.isIrreducible_spinMinusSubrep`, where `S`
itself is reducible unless it is the zero-dimensional quadratic space. -/
