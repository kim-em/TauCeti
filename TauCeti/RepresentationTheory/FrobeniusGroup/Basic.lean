# Frobenius's theorem: the Frobenius kernel is a normal subgroup

Let `H` be a trivial-intersection subgroup of a finite group `G` (`TauCeti.IsTISubgroup`), as a
Frobenius complement is.  The **Frobenius kernel** `TauCeti.frobeniusKernel H` — the identity
together with the elements of `G` lying in no conjugate of `H` — is available as a *set* for any
`H`, and for a trivial-intersection `H` it is already known to have `|G : H|` elements
(`TauCeti.IsTISubgroup.ncard_frobeniusKernel`) and to meet each conjugate of `H` only in the
identity.  What is *not* elementary, and is proved here, is that it is a **subgroup**: closure
under multiplication is Frobenius's theorem, and no proof avoiding character theory is known.

This file supplies the character theory.  Over `ℂ`, induction from a trivial-intersection subgroup
is an isometry on the class functions vanishing at the identity, and the correction
`φ* = Ind_H^G (φ - φ(1) · 1_H) + φ(1) · 1_G` turns an irreducible character of `H` into an
irreducible character of `G` restricting back to `φ`
(`TauCeti.ClassFunction.indExtend_mem_irreducibleCharacters`, the exceptional-character
correspondence).  Choosing a representation `σ_φ` affording each `φ*`, the **common kernel**
`N = ⨅_φ ker σ_φ` is a normal subgroup, and it *is* the Frobenius kernel:

* a *nonidentity* element `g` of the Frobenius kernel lies in no conjugate of `H`, so every summand
  of the induced class function vanishes at `g` and `φ*(g) = φ(1) = φ*(1)` — that is, `g ∈ N`; the
  identity, the one other element of the kernel, lies in `N` outright;
* conversely `N` is normal and `N ∩ H = 1`, because `Res_H φ* = φ` means an element of `N ∩ H`
  has the same value as the identity under every irreducible character of `H`, and the irreducible
  characters of a finite group detect the identity; so a nonidentity element of `N` can lie in no
  conjugate of `H`.

Both inclusions are equalities of *sets*, so the Frobenius kernel inherits the subgroup structure
of `N`.  The bundled subgroup is `TauCeti.frobeniusKernelSubgroup`, and with the counting already
available it is a complement to `H`, so `G` is the semidirect product of the kernel by the
complement.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.frobeniusKernelSubgroup`: **Frobenius's theorem** — the Frobenius kernel, bundled as a
  subgroup, with `TauCeti.coe_frobeniusKernelSubgroup` and `TauCeti.mem_frobeniusKernelSubgroup`
  its carrier and membership, and `TauCeti.frobeniusKernelSubgroup_normal` its normality.
* `TauCeti.frobeniusKernel_isComplement'`: the kernel is a **complement** to `H`, so `G = N ⋊ H`.
* `TauCeti.frobeniusKernelSubgroup_ne_bot` and `TauCeti.frobeniusKernelSubgroup_ne_top`: when `H`
  is proper the kernel is nontrivial, and when `H` is nontrivial the kernel is proper — so for a
  Frobenius complement (`TauCeti.IsFrobeniusComplement`, which is both) the kernel is a **proper
  nontrivial** normal subgroup.
* `TauCeti.card_frobeniusKernelSubgroup`: the kernel has `|G : H|` elements.
* `TauCeti.card_dvd_card_frobeniusKernelSubgroup_sub_one`: **`|H| ∣ |N| - 1`**, with
  `TauCeti.coprime_card_card_frobeniusKernelSubgroup` and
  `TauCeti.card_lt_card_frobeniusKernelSubgroup` its two immediate consequences — a Frobenius
  complement and a Frobenius kernel have coprime orders, and a proper `H` is strictly smaller than
  its kernel.
* `TauCeti.frobeniusKernelSubgroup_eq_of_isComplement'`: **the kernel constructed here is the
  normal complement one started from**, whenever `G = N ⋊ H` with `N` normal.

A concrete Frobenius group is presented the other way round, as a semidirect product `G = N ⋊ H`
whose complement acts on the kernel without nonidentity fixed points.  That presentation already
forces the trivial-intersection condition and already exhibits the kernel
(`TauCeti.isTISubgroup_of_isComplement'_of_fixedPointFree` and
`TauCeti.IsTISubgroup.coe_eq_frobeniusKernel_of_isComplement'`, both elementary), so
`TauCeti.frobeniusKernelSubgroup_eq_of_isComplement'` is the statement that the
character-theoretic construction above agrees with it.

## Implementation notes

Everything here needs only `TauCeti.IsTISubgroup H`, not the full
`TauCeti.IsFrobeniusComplement H`: properness and nontriviality of `H` play no part in the
character argument, and the degenerate cases are true as stated (`frobeniusKernel ⊤ = {1}` is the
carrier of `⊥`, and `frobeniusKernel ⊥ = Set.univ` that of `⊤`).  They are exactly what makes the
kernel itself nontrivial and proper, so the statements that need them take `H ≠ ⊤` and `H ≠ ⊥` as
plain hypotheses.

The arithmetic of the last three statements is not character theory: it is the freeness of the
conjugation action of `H` on the nonidentity part of the kernel, proved for a trivial-intersection
subgroup in `TauCeti/GroupTheory/FrobeniusKernel.lean` as
`TauCeti.IsTISubgroup.card_dvd_index_sub_one`.  What Frobenius's theorem adds here is only that the
kernel *is* a subgroup `N`, so that `|G : H|` may be read as `|N|`.

The bundled subgroup is read off a private existence statement with `Exists.choose`.  That keeps
the choice of affording representations — which is genuinely arbitrary — inside a single proof,
rather than spread over an auxiliary definition whose `Invertible (Nat.card G : ℂ)` instance would
then have to be produced identically at every use site.  Nothing downstream depends on which
subgroup the choice returns: `TauCeti.coe_frobeniusKernelSubgroup` pins its carrier, and a subgroup
is determined by its carrier.

The separation input — that a nonidentity element of a finite group is moved by some irreducible
character — is the private `TauCeti.eq_one_of_forall_irreducibleCharacter_eq` below.  It is the
completeness theorem `TauCeti.ClassFunction.le_span_irreducibleCharacters` applied to the indicator
class function of the identity class, which is `1` at the identity and `0` elsewhere.

variable {G : Type u} [Group G] [Finite G] {H : Subgroup G}

/-- **Frobenius's theorem.**  For a trivial-intersection subgroup `H` of a finite group `G` — a
Frobenius complement, in the nondegenerate case — the Frobenius kernel is the carrier of a normal
subgroup of `G`.

The proof is the exceptional-character correspondence.  Each irreducible character `φ` of `H`
extends to an irreducible character `φ*` of `G` with `φ*(1) = φ(1)` and `Res_H φ* = φ`; choose a
representation `σ_φ` affording `φ*` and let `N` be the common kernel of the `σ_φ`, a normal
subgroup.  A *nonidentity* element of the Frobenius kernel lies in no conjugate of `H`, so every
summand of the induced class function `Ind_H^G (φ - φ(1) · 1_H)` vanishes there and `φ*` takes its
value at the identity, while the identity lies in `N` outright: the Frobenius kernel is contained
in `N`.  Conversely a nonidentity element of `N` lying in a conjugate of `H` may be conjugated into
`H` — `N` being normal — where `Res_H φ* = φ` makes every irreducible character of `H` take its
identity value, forcing it to *be* the identity.

The two inclusions are of sets, so the Frobenius kernel is the carrier of `N`.  This is the
implementation step behind `TauCeti.frobeniusKernelSubgroup`; the statement to use is that
subgroup together with `TauCeti.coe_frobeniusKernelSubgroup` and
`TauCeti.frobeniusKernelSubgroup_normal`. -/
