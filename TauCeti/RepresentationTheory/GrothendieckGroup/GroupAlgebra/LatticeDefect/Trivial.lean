# The lattice defect of the trivial module `ℤ`

Let `G` be a finite group and `k` a field of characteristic `ℓ`. The group `ℤ` with the trivial
action of `G` has no `ℓ`-torsion, and its reduction `k ⊗_ℤ (ℤ ⧸ ℓℤ)` is the trivial line `k`. So
its lattice defect is the unit `1 = [k]` of the ring `G₀(k[G])`
(`TauCeti.latticeDefect_int_eq_one`).

This is the contribution of the value group whenever a `G`-module `V` is an extension of `ℤ` with
trivial action, `0 → V₀ → V → ℤ → 0`: by additivity, the defect of `V` is `1` plus that of `V₀`.
The main example is the valuation sequence `0 → 𝒪[L]ˣ → Lˣ → ℤ → 0` of a Galois extension of
local fields.

The action of `G` on `ℤ` is an arbitrary `DistribMulAction` together with the hypothesis that it
is trivial, since Mathlib has no trivial-action instance on `ℤ`. The finiteness of `ℤ ⧸ ℓℤ` and of
the `ℓ`-torsion of `ℤ`, which the definition of the defect asks for, are the instances
`TauCeti.finite_quotSMulTop_int` and `TauCeti.subsingleton_torsionBy_int`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.latticeDefect_int_eq_one`: the lattice defect of `ℤ` with the trivial action is `1`.
