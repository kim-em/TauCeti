# The standard representation of the symmetric group

The symmetric group on a finite type `α` acts on `k[α]` by permuting the standard basis.  Inside
that permutation representation sit the invariant line spanned by the sum of the basis, carrying the
trivial representation, and the **standard representation**, the subrepresentation of dimension
`|α| - 1` on which the coefficients sum to zero; when `|α|` is invertible in `k` the two are
complementary and the permutation representation splits as their direct sum.  This file proves that
the standard representation is irreducible whenever `|α| ≥ 2` and either `|α| = 2` or `|α|` is
invertible in `k`.

The hypothesis `2 ≤ |α|` is needed: for `|α| ≤ 1` the standard representation is zero, and the zero
representation is not irreducible.  Given `2 ≤ |α|`, the disjunction is sharp.  Invertibility of
`|α|` cannot simply be dropped: as soon as `3 ≤ |α|` and `|α| = 0` in `k`, the sum of the standard
basis itself has vanishing coefficient sum, so the invariant line lies *inside* the standard
subrepresentation, and it is a proper subrepresentation because the standard one has dimension
`|α| - 1 ≥ 2`, so the latter is reducible -- this is the first place the modular theory departs
from the ordinary one, and it is excluded here rather than developed.  The remaining case is the
first disjunct: for `|α| = 2` the standard subrepresentation is a line -- in characteristic `2` it
*is* the invariant line -- and hence irreducible whatever the characteristic.

The argument is elementary and uses only transpositions.  If `v` has vanishing coefficient sum and
is nonzero, two of its coefficients differ, say at `x` and `y`; subtracting the transposition
`(x y)` applied to `v` from `v` leaves exactly `(v x - v y) • (x - y)`, so any nonzero invariant
subspace contains one difference `x - y` of basis vectors.  Transposing `y` with an arbitrary `z`
produces all the others, and those differences span.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.standardRepresentation`: the standard representation of `Equiv.Perm α` on the
  augmentation subrepresentation of `k[α]`, with
  `TauCeti.toRepresentation_augmentationSubrepresentation` naming it as the action that
  subrepresentation carries, which is the form a splitting of `k[α]` produces.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.sub_ofMulAction_swap`: applying a transposition to `v` and subtracting leaves a multiple
  of a difference of two standard basis vectors.  This is the whole computational content.
* `TauCeti.isAtom_augmentationSubrepresentation`: the standard subrepresentation is an atom of the
  lattice of subrepresentations of `k[α]`, and
  `TauCeti.isIrreducible_standardRepresentation`: hence it is irreducible.
* `TauCeti.char_standardRepresentation`: its character is the character of `k[α]` less `1`, the
  `1` being the character of the trivial quotient of `k[α]` by the standard subrepresentation.

The two remaining halves of the picture hold for an arbitrary permutation representation and are
proved there, in `TauCeti.RepresentationTheory.Augmentation`: that `k[α]` is the direct sum of the
invariant line and the standard subrepresentation, again under `|α| ≠ 0` in `k` (or `α` empty), is
`TauCeti.isCompl_invariantLine_augmentationSubrepresentation`, and that the standard
subrepresentation has dimension `|α| - 1` is `TauCeti.finrank_augmentationSubrepresentation`.

invariant line lies inside it instead.  Over `ℚ` and on the labels `α = Fin μ.card` of a Young
