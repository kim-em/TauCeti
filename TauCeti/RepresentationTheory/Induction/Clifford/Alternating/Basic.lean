# Clifford theory along `A₄ ◁ S₄`: the inertia group of a linear character

The alternating group is normal in the symmetric group, so Clifford theory applies to the pair
`alternatingGroup α ◁ Equiv.Perm α`, and the first thing it asks for is the **inertia group** of a
representation of the normal subgroup. This file computes it for a linear character: for a
*nontrivial* `χ : alternatingGroup α →* kˣ`,

`inertia (FDRep.ofLinearCharacter χ) = alternatingGroup α`,

the smallest value Clifford theory allows, `TauCeti.le_inertia` giving the other inclusion for
free. The computation is the group theory of `TauCeti.GroupTheory.Perm.AlternatingCharacter`: an
odd permutation inverts every linear character of the alternating group, so it moves a nontrivial
one, and `χ` and `χ⁻¹` are two distinct characters making up one conjugation orbit.

A minimal inertia group is exactly what the Mackey irreducibility criterion for an induced linear
character wants, so `Ind` of a nontrivial `χ` is irreducible; and induction from a subgroup of
index two doubles the dimension, so what it produces is a **two-dimensional irreducible
representation** of `Equiv.Perm α`.
That dimension count needs nothing new: `TauCeti.finrank_indFDRep_ofLinearCharacter` and
`alternatingGroup.index_eq_two` give it in one step wherever it is wanted.

For `Nat.card α = 4` this is the `A₄ ◁ S₄` case, and it is not vacuous:
`TauCeti.exists_monoidHom_alternatingGroup_ne_one` produces a nontrivial linear character of `A₄`
from the identification of its commutator subgroup with the Klein four subgroup. The `example`
closing the file records that case: over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, `S₄`
has a two-dimensional irreducible representation induced from `A₄`.

That the nontrivial linear characters of `A₄` are *exactly* `χ` and `χ⁻¹`, and so form a single
`S₄`-orbit rather than merely a pair inside one, is the character count
`TauCeti.card_monoidHom_alternatingGroup` and its consequence
`TauCeti.exists_comp_conjNormal_alternatingGroup_eq`, proved with the rest of the group theory in
`TauCeti.GroupTheory.Perm.AlternatingCharacter`. One further fact about the pair `A₄ ◁ S₄` lies
outside the scope of this file: that the three-dimensional irreducible of `A₄` is `S₄`-fixed, the
case of the Clifford correspondence complementary to the one treated here.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.inertia_ofLinearCharacter_alternatingGroup`: **the inertia group of a nontrivial linear
  character of the alternating group is the alternating group.**
* `TauCeti.simple_indFDRep_ofLinearCharacter_alternatingGroup`: **a nontrivial linear character of
  the alternating group induces irreducibly** to the symmetric group.

/- The `A₄ ◁ S₄` case, recorded without claiming a name for it: over an algebraically closed field
of characteristic zero `A₄` has a nontrivial linear character, its inertia group in `S₄` is `A₄`,
and what it induces to is the two-dimensional irreducible representation of `S₄`. The conjuncts
are `inertia_ofLinearCharacter_alternatingGroup` and
`simple_indFDRep_ofLinearCharacter_alternatingGroup`, applied to a character supplied by
`exists_monoidHom_alternatingGroup_ne_one`, together with `finrank_indFDRep_ofLinearCharacter` and
`alternatingGroup.index_eq_two`. -/
