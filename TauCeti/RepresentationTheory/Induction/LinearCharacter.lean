# Inducing a linear character

Two facts about `Ind_N^G` applied to a linear character, both independent of any irreducibility
question and so of the Mackey theory that the worked examples go on to use.

The first is a dimension count. Induction from a subgroup of finite index multiplies the dimension
by the index (`TauCeti.finrank_indFDRep`), and the representation carrying a linear character is a
line (`FDRep.finrank_ofLinearCharacter`), so what a linear character of `N` induces to has
dimension exactly `N.index`, whatever the group and whatever the character: this is the count every
worked example of induction from a linear character opens with.

The second is a character identity, for a linear character of `N` that extends to the ambient
group -- that is, one of the form `χ ∘ N.subtype` for `χ : G →* kˣ`. The character of
`Ind_N^G (Res_N χ)` is then `χ` times the permutation character `Ind_N^G 1`. This is the
character-level form of the projection formula, `Subgroup.indClassFun_comp_subtype_mul` read on the
class function of `χ` against the constant function `1`; like that formula it holds over any field
and for any subgroup of finite index, with no hypothesis on the characteristic.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.finrank_indFDRep_ofLinearCharacter`: what a linear character induces to has the
  dimension of the index of the subgroup.
* `TauCeti.character_indFDRep_ofLinearCharacter_comp_subtype`: inducing the restriction of a
  linear character of the ambient group multiplies the permutation character by that character.
