# The dimension-shifting sequences

For a representation `A` of a group `G`, the embedding `A ⟶ Coind_⊥^G A` into the representation
coinduced from the trivial subgroup and the projection `Ind_⊥^G A ⟶ A` from the induced
representation give short exact sequences

`0 ⟶ A ⟶ Coind_⊥^G A ⟶ dimensionShiftUp A ⟶ 0` and
`0 ⟶ dimensionShiftDown A ⟶ Ind_⊥^G A ⟶ A ⟶ 0`,

which stay short exact after restriction along any monoid homomorphism `H →* G`. As
representations of `G` itself, the middle terms have vanishing positive-degree cohomology
(`groupCohomology.isZero_coindBot_succ`), respectively homology
(`groupHomology.isZero_indBot_succ`), and for a finite group vanishing Tate cohomology in every
degree (`TauCeti.TateCohomology.isZero_coindBot`, `TauCeti.TateCohomology.isZero_indBot`), so the
connecting homomorphisms of these sequences shift degrees. This is the *dimension shifting* of
Milne, *Class Field Theory*, II 1.13 and 1.28; this file provides the sequences themselves.

The constructions follow `ClassFieldTheory/Cohomology/Functors/UpDown.lean` in
`kbuzzard/ClassFieldTheory`, commit `ccc3323c6750abca25b49b35106f54eb3a398509`.

## Main definitions

* `Rep.dimensionShiftUp`, `Rep.dimensionShiftUpπ`, `Rep.dimensionShiftUpSES`: the cokernel of
  `A ⟶ Coind_⊥^G A` and its short complex.
* `Rep.dimensionShiftDown`, `Rep.dimensionShiftDownι`, `Rep.dimensionShiftDownSES`: the kernel of
  `Ind_⊥^G A ⟶ A` and its short complex.
* `Rep.dimensionShiftUpπIsCokernel`, `Rep.dimensionShiftDownιIsKernel`: their universal
  properties. The definitions are opaque, so consumers construct maps through these properties.
* `Rep.dimensionShiftUpMap`, `Rep.dimensionShiftDownMap`: the maps a morphism of coefficients
  induces on the two shifts, and `Rep.dimensionShiftUpSESMap`, `Rep.dimensionShiftDownSESMap`: the
  morphisms it induces between the short complexes.
* `Rep.dimensionShiftUpFunctor`, `Rep.dimensionShiftDownFunctor`: the two shifts as endofunctors
  of `Rep k G`, with the natural transformations `Rep.dimensionShiftUpπNatTrans` and
  `Rep.dimensionShiftDownιNatTrans`, and `Rep.dimensionShiftUpSESFunctor`,
  `Rep.dimensionShiftDownSESFunctor`: the two sequences as functors to short complexes.

## Main statements

* `Rep.dimensionShiftUpSES_def`, `Rep.dimensionShiftDownSES_def`: the maps in the two short
  complexes.
* `Rep.dimensionShiftUpSES_shortExact`, `Rep.dimensionShiftUpSES_res_shortExact`,
  `Rep.dimensionShiftUpSES_tensorLeft_shortExact`: the upward sequence is short exact, also after
  restriction and after tensoring on the left with any representation.
* `Rep.dimensionShiftDownSES_shortExact`, `Rep.dimensionShiftDownSES_res_shortExact`,
  `Rep.dimensionShiftDownSES_tensorLeft_shortExact`: the same for the downward sequence.
* `Rep.dimensionShiftUpπ_naturality`, `Rep.dimensionShiftDownι_naturality`: the coefficient maps
  commute with the quotient projection and with the kernel inclusion.
