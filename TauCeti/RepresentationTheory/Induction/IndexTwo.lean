# Inducing a linear character from an inverted subgroup of index two

Let `N` be a subgroup of index two in a finite group `G` -- so `N` is normal -- and suppose a
single element `s` outside `N` conjugates `N` by inversion, `s * x * s⁻¹ = x⁻¹`.  That hypothesis
already forces every element outside `N` to conjugate by inversion as well
(`TauCeti.conj_eq_inv_of_notMem_of_index_two`).  It is the shape of a dihedral group over its
rotations and of a dicyclic group over its cyclic subgroup, and it makes the character of the
representation induced from a linear character `ψ` of `N` completely explicit: it vanishes off `N`
(`TauCeti.character_indFDRep_eq_zero_of_notMem_of_index_two`, which needs neither the inversion
hypothesis nor linearity), and on `N` it is `ψ + ψ⁻¹` as soon as the order of `N` is invertible in
the coefficient field, which the average form of the induced character below asks for.

On `N` the average form `TauCeti.character_ind` of the induced character is the one to use.  A
linear character takes its values in the commutative group `kˣ`, so conjugating by an element of
`N` does not move it, while conjugating by an element outside `N` inverts it.  The two halves of
`G` are equally large, so each contributes `|N|` copies of one of the two values, and the factor
`|N|⁻¹` in front of the average cancels them.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.character_indFDRep_eq_zero_of_notMem_of_index_two`: **off a subgroup of index two, an
  induced character vanishes.**
* `TauCeti.character_indFDRep_ofLinearCharacter_eq_add_inv_of_mem_of_conj_eq_inv`: **on the
  subgroup, the character induced from a linear character is `ψ + ψ⁻¹`**, provided the order of
  the subgroup is invertible in the coefficient field.

/-- **Off a subgroup of index two, an induced character vanishes.**  A subgroup of index two is
normal, so this is `TauCeti.character_indFDRep_eq_zero_of_notMem` stated against the explicit
hypothesis `N.index = 2` that the formula on `N` below is stated against, rather than against a
`N.Normal` instance a user holding only that hypothesis cannot synthesize. -/

/-- **On an inverted subgroup of index two, the character induced from a linear character `ψ` is
`ψ + ψ⁻¹`.**  Together with `TauCeti.character_indFDRep_eq_zero_of_notMem_of_index_two`, which
gives the value `0` off `N` from the same hypothesis `hindex`, this determines the induced
character on all of `G`.  The hypothesis `hN` asks that the order of `N` be invertible in `k`. -/
