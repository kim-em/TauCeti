# Irreducible representations of nilpotent groups are monomial

Over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, every irreducible representation of a
finite nilpotent group `G` is induced from a one-dimensional representation of a subgroup: there
are a subgroup `H` and a linear character `χ : H →* kˣ` with

`W ≅ Ind_H^G χ`, equivalently `χ_W = Ind_H^G χ`.

In the classical language, finite nilpotent groups are *M-groups*.  The elementary groups of
Brauer's induction theorem are nilpotent (`TauCeti.IsElementary.isNilpotent`), so their irreducible
characters are induced from linear characters, whose values are roots of unity; this is how
Brauer's theorem is sharpened to a statement about fields of definition.

## The argument

The proof is by induction on `|G|`.  Let `W` be irreducible.

* If the operators `W.ρ g` commute pairwise, Schur's lemma makes each of them a scalar, `W` is a
  line, and its character is a linear character of `G = ⊤`
  (`FDRep.exists_character_eq_of_commute`).
* Otherwise let `K` be the kernel of `W` and `Z = upperCentralSeriesStep K` the elements acting
  centrally.  As `G` is nilpotent and `Z ≠ ⊤`, some `x` lies one step above `Z` but not in `Z`
  (`TauCeti.lt_upperCentralSeriesStep`), and the normal closure `A` of `x` acts through pairwise
  commuting operators (`TauCeti.commutator_normalClosure_singleton_le`).
* Choose an irreducible constituent `V` of `Res_A W`.  Schur's lemma makes `A` act on `V` by
  scalars.  If the inertia group of `V` were all of `G`, those scalars would be invariant under
  conjugation and `A` would act on all of `W` by them
  (`FDRep.commute_of_inertia_eq_top`); then `x` would act centrally, that is
  `x ∈ Z`.  So the inertia group `T` is proper.
* By the Clifford correspondence (`FDRep.exists_simple_liesOver_inertia_nonempty_iso_indFDRep`)
  `W ≅ Ind_T^G U` for an irreducible `U` of `T`, and `T` is nilpotent and smaller, so
  `χ_U = Ind_L^T χ` by induction.  Transitivity of induction
  (`Subgroup.indClassFun_indClassFun_subgroupOf`) finishes.

## Main statements

* `FDRep.exists_character_eq_indClassFun_of_isNilpotent`: the character of an irreducible
  representation of a finite nilpotent group is induced from a linear character of a subgroup.
* `FDRep.exists_nonempty_iso_indFDRep_ofLinearCharacter_of_isNilpotent`: the representation
  itself is induced from a one-dimensional representation of a subgroup.
