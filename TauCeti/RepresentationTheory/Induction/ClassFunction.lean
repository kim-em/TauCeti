# The induced class function

Induction of representations along a finite-index subgroup `S ≤ G` sends a character of `S` to a
character of `G`, by the coset-representative formula
`TauCeti.character_indFDRep_sum_quotient`.  That formula makes sense for an arbitrary function on
`S`, and this file takes it as the definition of the **induced class function**
`Subgroup.indClassFun`.  It is the linearization of induction on characters, and the map that turns
the restriction/induction pair into an adjoint pair on class functions.

Nothing here mentions a representation, so the file sits below
`TauCeti.RepresentationTheory.Induction.Character`, which imports it to identify the induced
character with the induced class function of a character (`Subgroup.indClassFun_ofFDRep_character`)
and to deduce `TauCeti.character_ind` from `Subgroup.indClassFun_eq_natCard_inv_mul_sum`.

## Main definitions

* `Function.indTerm f g x`: the summand attached to a representative `x`, namely `f (x⁻¹ g x)`
  when `x⁻¹ g x` lies in the subgroup and `0` otherwise.  It is the summand of the
  induced-character formula too, which the character file uses at `f = ρ.character`, together
  with the coset-invariance lemma `Function.indTerm_eq_of_mk_eq` and the evaluations
  `Function.indTerm_conj` and `Function.indTerm_one`.
* `Subgroup.indClassFun S f`: the function `G → k` obtained from `f : S → k` by summing `f` over
  those left coset representatives that conjugate `g` into `S`.  There is no division by `|S|`,
  so it needs no invertibility hypothesis and no more than an additive commutative monoid of
  coefficients.
* `Subgroup.indClassFunAddHom S`: the same construction packaged as an additive map
  `(S → k) →+ (G → k)`, which is what lets a property be propagated through the additive
  generation of an `AddSubgroup` of functions.
* `Subgroup.indClassFunction S`: the same construction packaged as a `k`-linear map
  `ClassFunction k S →ₗ[k] ClassFunction k G`.

## Main statements

* `Function.indTerm_eq_zero_of_smul_mk_ne` and
  `Subgroup.indClassFun_eq_sum_of_smul_eq_self_mem`: only the cosets `g` fixes contribute, so the
  coset sum may be taken over any finite set of cosets containing the fixed ones.  This is what
  turns the formula into a finite explicit computation for a concrete group.
* `Function.indTerm_eq_of_mk_eq_of_conj`: a summand depends only on its coset representative when
  the inducing function is invariant under conjugation in the subgroup.
* `Subgroup.indClassFun_conj` and `Subgroup.indClassFun_mem_classFunction`: induction preserves
  conjugation invariance over additive coefficients and sends class functions to class functions.
* `Subgroup.indClassFun_bot`: induction from the trivial subgroup is supported at the identity.
* `Subgroup.indClassFun_top` and `Subgroup.indClassFun_indClassFun_subgroupOf`: for
  conjugation-invariant inducing functions, induction from `⊤` is the identity, and induction is
  transitive along `L ≤ T ≤ G`.
* `Subgroup.natCard_nsmul_indClassFun`: for a conjugation-invariant function `f`, the additive
  group-sum form `|S| • (Ind f)(g) = ∑_{x ∈ G} f(x⁻¹gx)`, and its averaged corollary
  `Subgroup.indClassFun_eq_natCard_inv_mul_sum`.
* `Subgroup.indClassFun_comp_subtype_mul`: the **projection formula**,
  `Ind_S^G ((Res_S f) · ψ) = f · Ind_S^G ψ` for a class function `f` of `G`.

Frobenius reciprocity for class functions, `⟨Ind f, h⟩_G = ⟨f, Res h⟩_S`, is
`TauCeti.frobenius_reciprocity_classFunction`; it needs the pairing, so it lives with the other
reciprocities in `TauCeti.RepresentationTheory.Induction.FrobeniusReciprocity`.

## Implementation notes

The definition sums over `Quotient.out` representatives of `G ⧸ S`, so it literally matches
`TauCeti.character_indFDRep_sum_quotient`.  For a general `f` the individual summands depend on
that choice of representatives; being a class function is a sufficient condition for them not to,
and that is what `Subgroup.indClassFun_mem_classFunction` extracts, in the form of conjugation
invariance of the total sum. The additive and scalar identities hold for arbitrary functions.

`Function.indTerm` and the lemmas that evaluate it are shared, not internal to this file:
`TauCeti.RepresentationTheory.Induction.Character` sums it over right cosets and
`TauCeti.RepresentationTheory.Induction.FrobeniusReciprocity` sums it over all of `G`.
`Function.indTerm_eq_of_mk_eq_of_conj` gives representative independence for explicitly
conjugation-invariant functions over coefficients with zero; `Function.indTerm_eq_of_mk_eq`
specializes it to class functions.

/-- **The induced class function.**  For `f : S → k` and `g : G`, sum `f (t⁻¹ g t)` over those

The sum has no division by `|S|`, so the definition needs nothing of the coefficients beyond
addition; the averaged group-sum form is `Subgroup.indClassFun_eq_natCard_inv_mul_sum`.  On a
character it is the character of the induced representation, by
`Subgroup.indClassFun_ofFDRep_character`.

The representatives are the fixed `Quotient.out` ones, so this is a function of `f` alone; and for a
conjugation-invariant `f` the individual summands, and hence the sum, are independent of the
representatives chosen.  `Subgroup.indClassFunction` is the bundled form on

section Projection

variable {f : G → k}

/-- **The projection formula, on a single summand.**  The summand only ever evaluates a function on
`S` at a conjugate of `g`, so multiplying by the restriction of a class function `f` of `G`
multiplies the summand by the constant `f g`.

It is private: `Subgroup.indClassFun_comp_subtype_mul` is the projection formula every consumer
uses. -/

/-- **The projection formula for the induced class function**:
`Ind_S^G ((Res_S f) · ψ) = f · Ind_S^G ψ` for a class function `f` of `G` and an arbitrary
function `ψ` on `S`.

This is the class-function shadow of the tensor identity `TauCeti.indProjection`, and it is what
makes induction a map of modules over the ring of class functions: an induced function may be
multiplied by `f` either before or after inducing.  Only `f` is required to be a class function;
the identity is pointwise in `ψ`. -/
