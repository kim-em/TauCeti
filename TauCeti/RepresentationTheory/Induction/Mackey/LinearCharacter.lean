# Inducing a linear character from a normal subgroup

Let `N` be a normal subgroup of a finite group `G` and let `χ : N →* kˣ` be a linear character,
carried by the one-dimensional representation `FDRep.ofLinearCharacter χ`.  The Mackey
irreducibility criterion for a normal subgroup, `TauCeti.simple_indFDRep_iff_of_normal`, asks that
the representation be irreducible -- automatic here, a line having no proper nonzero
subrepresentation -- and that no conjugate `{}^s (χ)` for `s ∉ N` be isomorphic to `χ`.  On a line
that second condition is an identity in `N →* kˣ`, because a one-dimensional representation is
determined by the scalar it acts by: `FDRep.nonempty_iso_ofLinearCharacter_iff`.  The criterion
therefore becomes elementary group theory: `Ind_N^G χ` is irreducible exactly when **no element
outside `N` stabilizes `χ`**, that is, when for every `s ∉ N` there is an `x ∈ N` with
`χ (s x s⁻¹) ≠ χ x`.

A subgroup of **index two inverted by conjugation** -- the rotation subgroup of a dihedral or of a
generalized quaternion group -- makes the condition uniform in `s`: conjugation sends `χ` to `χ⁻¹`
for every `s ∉ N`, so the criterion collapses to `χ ≠ χ⁻¹`, that some value of `χ` fails to square
to `1`.  This is `TauCeti.simple_indFDRep_ofLinearCharacter_iff_of_conj_eq_inv`, and the inversion
need only be checked on a single element outside `N`.

When `χ` is moreover **faithful** the condition loses all reference to `χ`: `χ (s x s⁻¹) ≠ χ x`
becomes `s x s⁻¹ ≠ x`, so the induced representation is irreducible exactly when the centralizer
of `N` in `G` is contained in `N`.  This is the form the classical examples are checked in --
`A₃ ◁ S₃` in `TauCeti.RepresentationTheory.Induction.Mackey.SymmetricThree.Basic`, and the rotation
subgroup of a dihedral group -- where the ambient group is visibly nonabelian on `N`.

The whole file is the normal-subgroup half of the roadmap's dichotomy: nothing induced from the
*non-normal* point stabilizer of `S₃` is irreducible
(`TauCeti.not_simple_indFDRep_stabilizer_perm_fin_three`), while a faithful character of the
normal subgroup `A₃` does induce irreducibly.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.conjNormalFDRep_ofLinearCharacter`: conjugating a one-dimensional representation
  conjugates its linear character, as an equality of objects.
* `TauCeti.simple_indFDRep_ofLinearCharacter_iff`: **the Mackey criterion for an induced linear
  character** -- `Ind_N^G χ` is irreducible exactly when no element outside `N` stabilizes `χ`.
* `TauCeti.simple_indFDRep_ofLinearCharacter_iff_of_conj_eq_inv`: for an inverted subgroup of
  index two, exactly when some value of `χ` is not a square root of `1`.
* `TauCeti.simple_indFDRep_ofLinearCharacter_iff_centralizer_le`: for a faithful `χ`, exactly when
  `C_G(N) ≤ N`.

Not a `simp` lemma: with `conjNormalFDRep_ofLinearCharacter` tagged, `simp` already rewrites this
left-hand side to `χ.comp ↑(MulAut.conjNormal g)⁻¹ = χ` through
`FDRep.nonempty_iso_ofLinearCharacter_iff`, so tagging it too is a `simpNF` violation. This is the
pointwise spelling of that same condition. -/
