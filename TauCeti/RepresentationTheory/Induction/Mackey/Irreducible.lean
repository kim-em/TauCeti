# The Mackey irreducibility criterion

Let `H` be a subgroup of a finite group `G` and let `A` be a finite-dimensional representation of
`H` over an algebraically closed field in which `|G|` is invertible. The intertwining-number
formula `TauCeti.finrank_hom_indFDRep_mackey_erase` reads

`dim End_G(Ind_H^G A) = dim End_H A + ∑_{HsH ≠ H} dim Hom_{H ⊓ sHs⁻¹}(Res A, {}^s A)`,

a sum of natural numbers.  Over an algebraically closed field in which `|G|` is invertible a
finite-dimensional representation is irreducible exactly when its endomorphism algebra is a line
(Mathlib's `FDRep.simple_iff_end_is_rank_one`), so the left-hand side is `1` exactly when the first
summand is `1` and every other summand is `0`.  That reading is the **Mackey irreducibility
criterion**: `Ind_H^G A` is irreducible if and only if `A` is irreducible and, for every
double coset `HsH` other than `H` itself, the two restrictions `Res_{H ⊓ sHs⁻¹} A` and
`Res_{H ⊓ sHs⁻¹} ({}^s A)` are **disjoint**, that is, have no nonzero intertwiner.  Disjointness is
named here as `TauCeti.MackeyDisjoint`, and both forms of the criterion are stated through it.

The criterion comes in two forms.  The primary one, `TauCeti.simple_indFDRep_iff_doubleCoset`,
quantifies over the double cosets `H \ G / H` and reads each Mackey term at
the fixed representative `Quotient.out`.  The elementwise form, `TauCeti.simple_indFDRep_iff`,
quantifies over the group elements `s ∉ H` instead.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.MackeyDisjoint`: the restrictions of `A` and of `{}^s A` to the Mackey subgroup
  `H ⊓ sHs⁻¹` admit no nonzero intertwiner.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.mackeyDisjoint_iff_subsingleton`, `TauCeti.MackeyDisjoint.eq_zero` and
  `TauCeti.mackeyDisjoint_of_forall_eq_zero`: the predicate read back as the vanishing of every
  intertwiner.
* `TauCeti.simple_indFDRep_iff_doubleCoset`: the Mackey irreducibility criterion over the double
  cosets.
* `TauCeti.simple_indFDRep_iff`: the same criterion quantified over the elements outside `H`.
* `TauCeti.simple_indFDRep_iff_of_normal`: for `H ◁ G`, induction of `A` is irreducible exactly
  when `A` is irreducible and no conjugate `{}^s A`, for `s ∉ H`, is isomorphic to `A`.
* `TauCeti.mackeyDisjoint_mul_left_mul_right_iff`: Mackey disjointness depends only on the double
  coset.

## Implementation notes

`TauCeti.MackeyDisjoint` is stated as `Subsingleton` of the intertwining space; the
intertwining-number formula produces the dimension of that space instead, and
`TauCeti.mackeyDisjoint_iff_finrank_eq_zero` is the bridge between the two readings, along which
the double-coset criterion is proved.  That bridge is deliberately not a `simp` lemma: the named
predicate is the form the criteria are stated in and the form its own API
(`TauCeti.mackeyDisjoint_mul_left_mul_right_iff`) applies to, so unfolding it to a dimension on
sight would be the wrong normal form.

The step in those proofs that the arithmetic does not hand over for free is that `dim End_H A`
cannot be `0`: a representation with no nonzero endomorphism is a zero object, and then every term
of the sum vanishes too, so the total could not be `1`.  That is what the two private helpers of
the `ZeroObject` section below record.

Passing between the two forms of the criterion needs the Mackey term to be constant on a double
coset, which is `TauCeti.finrank_hom_res_mackeyToH_mul_left_mul_right`, proved with the formula it
belongs to; `TauCeti.mackeyDisjoint_mul_left_mul_right_iff` is its reading through the predicate.

The dimension formula follows from `FDRep.indHomMackeyLinearEquiv` and holds over every
field. The criteria require only `[NeZero (Nat.card G : k)]`, the Maschke hypothesis used by
Mathlib's `FDRep.simple_iff_end_is_rank_one`, rather than a characteristic-zero assumption.
`TauCeti.MackeyDisjoint` and its API hold over any field.

For a normal subgroup the Mackey subgroup is all of `H`.  Restricting along
`TauCeti.mackeySubgroupNormalEquiv` shows that the corresponding Mackey term and
`Hom_H(A, {}^s A)` have equal dimensions, and `TauCeti.simple_indFDRep_iff_of_normal` gives the
resulting normal-subgroup corollary. This is the form used by Clifford theory.
