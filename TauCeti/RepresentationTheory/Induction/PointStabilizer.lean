# Inducing the trivial representation from a point stabilizer

Let `α` be a finite set and let `x₀ : α`.  The symmetric group `Equiv.Perm α` acts transitively on
`α`, so the coset space of the stabilizer of `x₀` is `α` itself, and inducing the trivial
representation of that stabilizer produces the permutation representation of `Equiv.Perm α` on
`α`.  This file makes that identification, reads off its character as the fixed-point count, and
computes the invariant the permutation representation is pinned down by: the double cosets of the
stabilizer, of which there are exactly two, and hence the self-pairing of the induced character.

The two double cosets are the source of everything else.  A permutation either fixes `x₀` or does
not, and each of the two possibilities is a single double coset, by
`TauCeti.card_doubleCosetQuotient_stabilizer`.  So `⟨Ind 1, Ind 1⟩ = 2` whenever `|Equiv.Perm α|`
is invertible in `k`, and the permutation representation then has exactly two constituents, each
with multiplicity one.  When moreover `(|α| : k) ≠ 0` those two constituents are named: the
trivial representation on the invariant line, split off by
`TauCeti.isCompl_invariantLine_augmentationSubrepresentation`, and the standard representation of
`TauCeti.RepresentationTheory.Symmetric.Standard`, which is irreducible under that same
hypothesis.  In the excluded characteristics the character identity
`TauCeti.char_ind_trivial_stabilizer_eq_one_add_char_standardRepresentation` still holds, but the
invariant line lies inside the standard representation instead of complementing it, so there is no
such splitting.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.indTrivialStabilizerEquiv` and `TauCeti.indTrivialStabilizerIso`: inducing the trivial
  representation of the stabilizer of `x₀` gives the permutation representation on `α`, as an
  equivalence of representations and as an isomorphism in `Rep k (Equiv.Perm α)`.  Both are read
  on generators by `TauCeti.indTrivialStabilizerEquiv_apply_mk` and
  `TauCeti.indTrivialStabilizerIso_hom_hom_mk`.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.char_ind_trivial_stabilizer`: the character of the induced trivial representation at `σ`
  is the number of points fixed by `σ`, and `TauCeti.finrank_ind_trivial_stabilizer` says the
  representation has dimension `|α|`.
* `TauCeti.characterPairing_ind_trivial_stabilizer`: for `|Equiv.Perm α|` invertible in `k`, its
  self-pairing is `2`, the number of double cosets.
* `TauCeti.char_ind_trivial_stabilizer_eq_one_add_char_standardRepresentation`: the induced
  character is the trivial character plus the character of the standard representation.  This is
  an identity of characters and holds in every characteristic; it is a decomposition of
  representations only under the hypotheses of
  `TauCeti.isCompl_invariantLine_augmentationSubrepresentation`.
* `TauCeti.card_doubleCosetQuotient_stabilizer_fin_four`,
  `TauCeti.finrank_ind_trivial_stabilizer_fin_four`,
  `TauCeti.finrank_augmentationSubrepresentation_fin_four` and
  `TauCeti.isIrreducible_standardRepresentation_fin_four`: the `S₄` instance -- two double cosets,
  a `4`-dimensional induced representation, and a `3`-dimensional complement, irreducible when
  `4 ≠ 0` in `k`.

## Implementation notes

The two double cosets of the point stabilizer are counted in
`TauCeti.GroupTheory.DoubleCoset.PointStabilizer`, which is pure group theory, and the
identification of the coset space with `α` is `TauCeti.quotientStabilizerEquiv`, in
`TauCeti.GroupTheory.GroupAction.Transitive`.

The coefficient field and the acted-on set share a universe in the `Rep`-level isomorphism, since
that compares two objects of one category; the `Representation`-level statements, which is where
the characters are computed, carry no such constraint.

## References

This is the "Permutation characters and fixed points" worked example of
`TauCetiRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/InductionRestriction/README.md`: "For `G = S₄` and `H` a point
stabilizer `S₃`, `Ind_H^G(trivial)` is the natural permutation representation on `4` points; its
character at `g` is the number of fixed points of `g`, and `⟨Ind_H^G 1, Ind_H^G 1⟩ = #(H \ G / H) =
2`, the two double cosets being the diagonal and off-diagonal `H`-orbits on the four points, so it
splits as `trivial ⊕ (standard 3-dimensional)`."

three-dimensional irreducible. -/
