# Branching of the standard representation along the block inclusion

The block inclusion `TauCeti.glBlockSucc : GL (Fin n) k →* GL (Fin (n + 1)) k` puts a matrix in the
upper-left block and fixes the last basis vector, so restricting the standard representation of
`GL (Fin (n + 1)) k` along it leaves the last coordinate alone.  This file proves that, in the form

`Res (stdRep k (n + 1)) ≅ stdRep k n ⊕ 1`,

as `TauCeti.stdRepBlockSuccEquiv`, and records the resulting character identity
`TauCeti.char_stdRep_glBlockSucc`.

This is the branching problem `GL (n + 1) ↓ GL n` for the standard representation: the restriction
of the standard representation splits off a trivial summand and leaves the standard representation
of the smaller group.  The corresponding decomposition of the other irreducible representations
needs the highest-weight classification and is not proved here; what is proved here is the
restriction formula `TauCeti.stdRep_glBlockSucc_apply` that any such computation starts from,
together with this one splitting.

The splitting is `LinearEquiv.piFinSnoc`: a vector of `Fin (n + 1) → k` is its first `n`
coordinates together with its last, and that linear isomorphism is what carries the restricted
representation onto `Representation.prod`.  The same splitting branches the standard representation
of the orthogonal group in
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/ClassicalGroups/Branching/Orthogonal.lean`, where it is moreover
orthogonal for the invariant form.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.stdRepBlockSuccEquiv`: the branching isomorphism, an equivalence of representations of
  `GL (Fin n) k`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.stdRep_glBlockSucc_apply`: the restricted standard action multiplies the first `n`
  coordinates by `g` and fixes the last.
* `TauCeti.char_stdRep_glBlockSucc`: the character of the restriction is the character of the
  standard representation plus one.
* `TauCeti.stdRep_comp_glBlockSucc_injective`: the restriction is still faithful.
