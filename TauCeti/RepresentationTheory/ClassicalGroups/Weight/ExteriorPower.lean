# The weights of an exterior power of the standard representation

The standard representation of `GL n k` is the internal direct sum of its weight spaces, the
coordinate lines, with the `i`-th line carrying the weight `Pi.single i 1`
(`TauCeti.isInternal_weightSpace_stdRep`). This file computes the weight spaces of its exterior
powers, the representations `⋀ᵈ(kⁿ)`.

A wedge `e_{i₁} ∧ ⋯ ∧ e_{i_d}` of standard basis vectors is again a weight vector: a diagonal
matrix scales it by the product `t_{i₁} ⋯ t_{i_d}` of the corresponding entries. Its weight is
therefore the `0`/`1` indicator of the `d`-element subset `{i₁, …, i_d}`, which is
`TauCeti.weightOfSubset` below. Those wedges are Mathlib's basis
`Module.Basis.exteriorPower` of `⋀ᵈ(kⁿ)`, indexed by `Set.powersetCard (Fin n) d`, and distinct
subsets carry distinct weights, so — once distinct weights give distinct characters of the torus —
the weight spaces are the coordinate lines of that basis: the weight-`l` space is the line spanned
by the wedge of `s` if `l` is the indicator of `s`, and is zero otherwise. In particular every
weight of `⋀ᵈ(kⁿ)` has multiplicity one, and there are `n.choose d` of them.

So the weights of `⋀ᵈ(kⁿ)` are exactly the sums `Pi.single i₁ 1 + ⋯ + Pi.single i_d 1` of `d`
distinct weights of the standard representation, each occurring once. For `d = 0` the only weight
is `0`, and for `d > n` there is no weight at all, the exterior power being zero. For `1 ≤ d ≤ n`
the largest weight in the dominance order is `(1, …, 1, 0, …, 0)` with `d` ones, the `d`-th
fundamental weight of `GL n`; identifying it as the *highest* weight of `⋀ᵈ(kⁿ)` needs the
highest-weight classification and is not done here.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.weightOfSubset`: the weight of a subset of `Fin n`, its `0`/`1` indicator.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.extPowerRep_diagGL_apply_basis`: **a wedge of standard basis vectors is an eigenvector
  of every diagonal matrix**, with eigenvalue the product of the entries it selects.
* `TauCeti.basis_mem_weightSpace_extPowerRep`: that wedge lies in the weight space of the
  indicator weight of its index set.
* `TauCeti.iSup_weightSpace_extPowerRep_eq_top` and
  `TauCeti.isInternal_weightSpace_extPowerRep`: **the exterior power is the internal direct sum of
  its weight spaces.**
* `TauCeti.weightSpace_extPowerRep_eq_span`: **the weight spaces are the coordinate lines of the
  wedge basis**, with `TauCeti.weightSpace_extPowerRep_eq_bot` for the weights that are not
  indicators.
* `TauCeti.finrank_weightSpace_extPowerRep`: every weight of `⋀ᵈ(kⁿ)` has multiplicity one, and
  `TauCeti.weightSpace_extPowerRep_ne_bot_iff` says the weights are exactly the indicators.

## Implementation notes

Everything past the eigenvector computation is an instance of
`TauCeti.RepresentationTheory.ClassicalGroups.Weight.Basis`, which reads the weight spaces of a
representation off a basis of weight vectors; what is specific to the exterior power is the wedge
basis, the subset labelling, and the injectivity of that labelling.

The subset weight is packaged as `TauCeti.weightOfSubset`, taking a bare `Finset (Fin n)` rather
than an element of `Set.powersetCard (Fin n) d`: nothing in the definition or in its injectivity
uses the cardinality, and the consumers below apply it to the underlying finset of a basis index.
The cardinality reappears only in `TauCeti.sum_weightOfSubset`, which records that a weight of
`⋀ᵈ(kⁿ)` has total degree `d`.

As in `TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/ClassicalGroups/Weight/Basic.lean`, the statements that pin a
weight space down, rather than merely exhibiting vectors in it, assume that the coefficients
separate weights, in the sense that `l ↦ weightChar k l` is injective;
`TauCeti.weightChar_injective` supplies that over an infinite field. Without it the statements are
false: over `𝔽₂` the diagonal torus of `GL n 𝔽₂` is trivial, so every weight space of every
representation is everything.

The eigenvector computation itself is `Module.Basis.map_exteriorPower_of_apply`, the
exterior-power analogue of `Module.Basis.map_symmetricPower_of_apply`; it is what
`TauCeti.char_extPowerRep_diagonal` sums to get the elementary symmetric polynomial, and the
weight-space statements here refine that character identity to the decomposition behind it.
