# The weights of a symmetric power of the standard representation

The standard representation of `GL n k` is the internal direct sum of its weight spaces, the
coordinate lines, with the `i`-th line carrying the weight `Pi.single i 1`
(`TauCeti.isInternal_weightSpace_stdRep`).  This file computes the weight spaces of its symmetric
powers, the representations `Symᵈ(kⁿ)`.

A product `e_{i₁} ⋯ e_{i_d}` of standard basis vectors is again a weight vector: a diagonal matrix
scales it by the product `t_{i₁} ⋯ t_{i_d}` of the corresponding entries, repetitions included.
Its weight is therefore the **multiplicity vector** of the unordered tuple `{i₁, …, i_d}`, which is
`TauCeti.weightOfMultiset`.  Those products are the basis `Module.Basis.symmetricPower` of
`Sym[k]^d(Fin n → k)`, indexed by `Sym (Fin n) d`, and a multiset over `Fin n` is recovered from
its multiplicity vector, so the general machinery of
`TauCeti.RepresentationTheory.ClassicalGroups.Weight.Basis` applies verbatim: the weight-`l` space
is the line spanned by the product indexed by `s` when `l` is the multiplicity vector of `s`, and
is zero otherwise.

This is the exact counterpart of the exterior-power computation of
`TauCeti.RepresentationTheory.ClassicalGroups.Weight.ExteriorPower`, and the difference between
the two is precisely the difference between a subset and a multiset.  In `⋀ᵈ(kⁿ)` the weights are
the `0`/`1` indicators of the `d`-element subsets; in `Symᵈ(kⁿ)` the multiplicities are
unconstrained, so the weights are *all* the nonnegative integer vectors of total degree `d` —
`TauCeti.exists_sym_weightOfMultiset_eq_iff` characterizes them that way, and
`TauCeti.weightSpace_symPowerRep_ne_bot_iff_nonneg_sum_eq` reads that off as the description of
the weights of `Symᵈ(kⁿ)`: **the exponent vectors of the degree-`d` monomials in `n` variables**,
each of multiplicity one.  That is the weight-space refinement of
`TauCeti.char_symPowerRep_diagonal`, which sums those same monomials into the complete homogeneous
symmetric polynomial `h_d`.

For `d = 0` the only weight is `0`, and for `n = 0` and `d > 0` there is no weight at all, the
symmetric power being zero.  For `0 < n` the largest weight in the dominance order is
`(d, 0, …, 0)`; identifying it as the *highest* weight of `Symᵈ(kⁿ)` needs the highest-weight
classification and is not done here.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.symPowerRep_diagGL_apply_basis`: **a product of standard basis vectors is an
  eigenvector of every diagonal matrix**, with eigenvalue the product of the entries it lists.
* `TauCeti.basis_mem_weightSpace_symPowerRep`: that product lies in the weight space of the
  multiplicity vector of its index.
* `TauCeti.iSup_weightSpace_symPowerRep_eq_top` and
  `TauCeti.isInternal_weightSpace_symPowerRep`: **the symmetric power is the internal direct sum of
  its weight spaces.**
* `TauCeti.weightSpace_symPowerRep_eq_span`: **the weight spaces are the coordinate lines of the
  symmetric-power basis**, with `TauCeti.weightSpace_symPowerRep_eq_bot` for the weights that are
  not multiplicity vectors.
* `TauCeti.finrank_weightSpace_symPowerRep`: every weight of `Symᵈ(kⁿ)` has multiplicity one, while
  `TauCeti.weightSpace_symPowerRep_ne_bot_iff` and
  `TauCeti.weightSpace_symPowerRep_ne_bot_iff_nonneg_sum_eq` say the weights are exactly the
  multiplicity vectors, that is, exactly the nonnegative vectors of total degree `d`.

## Implementation notes

Everything past the eigenvector computation is an instance of
`TauCeti.RepresentationTheory.ClassicalGroups.Weight.Basis`, which reads the weight spaces of a
representation off a basis of weight vectors; what is specific to the symmetric power is the
product basis, the multiset labelling, and the injectivity of that labelling.  The multiplicity
vector itself and the combinatorics of which vectors arise are
`TauCeti.RepresentationTheory.ClassicalGroups.Weight.Combinatorics`, which mentions no
representation.

The coefficients are pinned to `k : Type` rather than a general universe, as everywhere in the
symmetric-power API: `TauCeti.SymmetricPower` is built on `PiTensorProduct` at that altitude.  The
exterior-power counterpart carries a universe variable for that reason alone.

As in `TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/ClassicalGroups/Weight/Basic.lean`, the statements that pin a
weight space down, rather than merely exhibiting vectors in it, assume that the coefficients
separate weights, in the sense that `l ↦ weightChar k l` is injective;
`TauCeti.weightChar_injective` supplies that over an infinite field.  Without it the statements are
false: over `𝔽₂` the diagonal torus of `GL n 𝔽₂` is trivial, so every weight space of every
representation is everything.
