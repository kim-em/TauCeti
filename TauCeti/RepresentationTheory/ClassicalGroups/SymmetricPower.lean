# Symmetric powers of the standard representation

This file specializes symmetric powers of representations to the standard representation of the
general linear group. The resulting action applies a matrix to every factor of a pure symmetric
tensor.

A diagonal matrix acts diagonally on the basis of `Sym[k]^d (Fin n → k)` given by the unordered
`d`-tuples of standard basis vectors, with eigenvalue the product of the corresponding diagonal
entries. Summing those eigenvalues, the character of the `d`th symmetric power at a diagonal
matrix is the `d`th complete homogeneous symmetric polynomial in its diagonal entries, dual to the
elementary symmetric polynomial the exterior power gives.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.symPowerRep` is the symmetric-power representation of `GL n k`.
* `TauCeti.symPowerFDRep` is its bundled finite-dimensional form.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.char_symPowerRep_diagonal` identifies the character on diagonal matrices with a
  complete homogeneous symmetric polynomial.

## References

* [Classical groups roadmap](https://github.com/TauCetiProject/TauCetiRoadmap/blob/main/TauCetiRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/ClassicalGroups/README.md),
  Layer 1, “Symmetric and exterior power representations”.
* The standard-representation specialization is adapted from the formal template in
  `TauCeti.RepresentationTheory.ClassicalGroups.ExteriorPower`.
