# Weight multiplicities and highest-weight lines of Weyl modules

The multiplicity of a nonnegative integer weight in a Weyl module is the Kostka number
counting semistandard tableaux of that content. In particular, the highest weight, given by
the row lengths of the shape, has multiplicity one. Determinant twisting gives the same
one-dimensional highest-weight space for the rational Weyl module of every dominant weight.

These dimension results hold over any field of characteristic zero. The polynomial highest-weight
result requires the shape to have at most `n` rows; the rational result applies to every dominant
integer weight, including negative entries and rank zero. Together with the dominance bounds and
irreducibility, they supply the highest-weight line for comparison with highest-weight modules.
