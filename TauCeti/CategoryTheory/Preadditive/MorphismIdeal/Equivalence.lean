# Equivalences of quotients by morphism ideals

Let `F : C ⥤ D` be an additive functor carrying a morphism ideal `I` of `C` into a morphism ideal
`J` of `D`, so that `F` induces `I.map J F hF : C/I ⥤ D/J`. This file records how the properties
of `F` pass to the induced functor:

* the induced functor is faithful exactly when `I` contains every morphism that `F` sends into
  `J`, that is when `J.comap F ≤ I`; no faithfulness of `F` itself is needed;
* it is full when `F ⋙ J.quotientFunctor` is full, and essentially surjective when this
  composite is; in particular, these properties descend from `F` itself;
* a full, essentially surjective `F ⋙ J.quotientFunctor` with `J.comap F ≤ I` induces an
  equivalence of quotients, without requiring `F` to be faithful;
* consequently an equivalence `e : C ≌ D` with `I = J.comap e.functor` induces an equivalence
  `C/I ≌ D/J`, whose inverse is the functor induced by `e.inverse`.

Pulling back along an equivalence is inverse to pulling back along its inverse, so the hypothesis
`I = J.comap e.functor` says precisely that `e` carries `I` onto `J`.

This is the mechanism by which an equivalence of additive categories matching two ideals, such as
an exact equivalence matching projective-injective objects, identifies the corresponding
quotient categories.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.MorphismIdeal.mapEquivalence`: the equivalence `C/I ≌ D/J` induced by an equivalence
  `C ≌ D` carrying `I` onto `J`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.MorphismIdeal.faithful_lift_iff`, `full_lift`, `essSurj_lift`, and
  `isEquivalence_lift`: faithfulness, fullness, essential surjectivity, and equivalence for a
  functor lifted through the quotient by an ideal in its kernel.
* `TauCeti.MorphismIdeal.map_map_quotientFunctor_map_eq_iff`: two morphisms become equal under
  the induced functor exactly when `F` sends their difference into `J`.
* `TauCeti.MorphismIdeal.faithful_map_iff`: the induced functor is faithful if and only if
  `J.comap F ≤ I`.
* `TauCeti.MorphismIdeal.full_map` and `TauCeti.MorphismIdeal.essSurj_map`: fullness and
  essential surjectivity descend from the composite with the target quotient functor.
* `TauCeti.MorphismIdeal.isEquivalence_map`: a full, essentially surjective composite with
  the target quotient functor induces an equivalence when `J.comap F ≤ I`.
* `TauCeti.MorphismIdeal.comap_inverse_comap_functor` and
  `TauCeti.MorphismIdeal.comap_functor_comap_inverse`: pullback along an equivalence and along
  its inverse are mutually inverse.
