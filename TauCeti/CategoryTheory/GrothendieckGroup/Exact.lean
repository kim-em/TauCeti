# Exact `K₀` of a Quillen exact category

The exact Grothendieck group `TauCeti.ExactK0 E` of an essentially small additive category `C`
equipped with a Quillen exact structure `E` is the free abelian group on the isomorphism classes
of objects modulo the relations `[X₂] = [X₁] + [X₃]`, one for each `E`-conflation
`X₁ ↪ X₂ ↠ X₃`. It is the universal recipient of an invariant which is constant on isomorphism
classes and additive on conflations.

The construction is the presentation engine of
`TauCeti/CategoryTheory/GrothendieckGroup/Presentation.lean` applied to the conflation relations,
so the skeleton and shrink choices are made once and for all there, and the whole public API
below is phrased in terms of objects and conflations of `C`.

Exact `K₀` is monotone in the exact structure: an exact structure with more conflations imposes
more relations, and `TauCeti.ExactK0.ofLE` is the resulting surjective comparison. The split
exact structure is the smallest one (`TauCeti.ExactStructure.conflation_of_splitting`), so
`TauCeti.ExactK0.fromSplit` compares `TauCeti.SplitK0 C` with the exact `K₀` of an arbitrary exact
structure on the same category. Both maps are characterized by their values on object classes,
and both are natural in conflation-exact functors.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.conflationRelation S`: the relation `[X₂] - [X₁] - [X₃]` attached to a short complex,
  and `TauCeti.exactRelations E` the family of those attached to the conflations of `E`.
* `TauCeti.ExactK0 E`: exact `K₀`, with class map `TauCeti.ExactK0.of`.
* `TauCeti.ExactK0.AdditiveInvariant E G`: an isomorphism-invariant, conflation-additive function
  on objects, and `TauCeti.ExactK0.lift` the homomorphism it induces.
* `TauCeti.ExactK0.RightAdditiveInvariant C E' G`: an object-level invariant additive on
  conflations in its second variable, and `TauCeti.ExactK0.RightAdditiveInvariant.rightLift` its
  one-sided descent.
* `TauCeti.ExactK0.BiadditiveInvariant E E' G`: a right-additive invariant which is also additive
  on conflations in its first variable, and `TauCeti.ExactK0.BiadditiveInvariant.bilift` its
  descent to both exact Grothendieck groups.
* `TauCeti.ExactK0.map` and `TauCeti.ExactK0.mapEquiv`: functoriality for conflation-exact
  functors and invariance under exact equivalences, with `TauCeti.ExactK0.transportEquiv` the
  instance of the latter for a transported exact structure.
* `TauCeti.ExactK0.ofLE` and `TauCeti.ExactK0.fromSplit`: the comparison induced by the identity
  functor towards an exact structure with more conflations, and its instance out of the split
  Grothendieck group; `TauCeti.ExactK0.ofLEEquiv` is the comparison isomorphism between exact
  structures with the same conflations.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.ExactK0.of_conflation`: the defining relation, with `TauCeti.ExactK0.of_biprod` and
  `TauCeti.ExactK0.of_eq_zero_of_isZero` its biproduct and zero-object consequences.
* `TauCeti.ExactK0.liftEquiv`: the universal property. Conflation-additive invariants with values
  in `G` correspond bijectively to homomorphisms `ExactK0 E →+ G`.
* `TauCeti.ExactK0.RightAdditiveInvariant.rightLift_of` and
  `TauCeti.ExactK0.RightAdditiveInvariant.rightLift_unique`: evaluation and uniqueness of the
  one-sided descent.
* `TauCeti.ExactK0.BiadditiveInvariant.bilift_of_of` and
  `TauCeti.ExactK0.BiadditiveInvariant.bilift_unique`: evaluation and uniqueness of the
  two-variable descent.
* `TauCeti.ExactK0.ofLE_unique` and `TauCeti.ExactK0.ofLE_surjective`: the comparison map is the
  unique homomorphism preserving object classes, and it is surjective, so exact `K₀` is a
  quotient of the exact `K₀` of any smaller exact structure.
* `TauCeti.ExactK0.fromSplitEquiv`: if every conflation splits, the canonical comparison from
  split `K₀` is an equivalence.
* `TauCeti.ExactK0.map_comp_ofLE`: naturality of the comparison in a conflation-exact functor.
