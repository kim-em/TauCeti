# Recurrent processes

A process `X : ℕ → Ω → α` is **recurrent** when, almost surely, every state it ever visits it
visits infinitely often:

```text
∀ᵐ ω ∂μ, ∀ k, ∃ᶠ n in atTop, X n ω = X k ω
```

The main theorem is that recurrence is automatic for a stationary process on a countable state
space (`recurrent_of_measurePreserving_shift`): it is Poincaré recurrence for the one-sided
shift, applied to the countably many coordinate events `{x | x 0 = a}` at once. The
exchangeability-specific corollaries of that theorem live in
`TauCeti.Probability.Exchangeability.Recurrence.Basic`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Probability.recurrent_def` — the defining equation of `Recurrent`, which is not
  `@[expose]`, so this is the unfolding interface downstream.
* `TauCeti.Probability.recurrent_iff_ae_forall_state` — the state-indexed reading of recurrence.
* `TauCeti.Probability.recurrent_of_measurePreserving_shift` — a process with a shift-invariant
  path law on a countable state space is recurrent.
* `TauCeti.Probability.recurrent_pathLaw_iff` — the process-level and path-law readings agree.

## References

  8 (1980), 115–130.

Mathlib's `MeasureTheory.Conservative` is recurrence of a map — the Poincaré recurrence theorem
— and is consumed here rather than reproved; recurrence of a process in the above sense is not in
Mathlib. No material is adapted from `cameronfreer/exchangeability`, which treats exchangeable
rather than Markov exchangeable sequences.

The one-sided shift is measure preserving, hence conservative, so almost every path whose orbit

space lets a single null set serve all `a` at once. -/
