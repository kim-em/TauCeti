# Sampling a random population along a random selection

A *population* is a map `x : κ → α`, and a *selection* is an index map `k : ι → κ`; reading the
selected entries gives the sample `x ∘ k : ι → α`. This file builds the law of that sample when
the population and the selection are drawn independently: for a population law
`ρ : Measure (κ → α)` and a selection law `σ : Measure (ι → κ)`, `samplePopulation σ ρ` is the
pushforward of `σ.prod ρ` along `(k, x) ↦ x ∘ k`.

The population index is countable with measurable singletons, which is what makes the reindexing
map measurable for an arbitrary state space `α`. Finite sampling with and without replacement are
the cases where `σ` is uniform on all index maps, respectively on the injective ones
(`TauCeti.Probability.sampleWithReplacement`, `TauCeti.Probability.sampleWithoutReplacement`).

## Main declarations

* `measurable_reindexPopulation` — measurability of the joint selection/population evaluation;
* `samplePopulation` — sample a random population along an independent random selection;
* `samplePopulation_apply`, `samplePopulation_apply_population` — its evaluation by
  conditioning on the selection or on the population;
* `samplePopulation_eq_bind`, `samplePopulation_eq_bind_population` — its form as a mixture,
  over the selection law or over the population law, of the samples with that input fixed.

/-- Sampling a random population along an independent random selection of its indices.

First draw a population `x : κ → α` with law `ρ`; independently draw an index map `k : ι → κ` with
law `σ`; then return the sample `i ↦ x (k i)`. Sampling without replacement
(`sampleWithoutReplacement`) and with replacement (`sampleWithReplacement`) are the cases where
`σ` is uniform on the injective index maps, respectively on all of them.

The population index is countable with measurable singletons because that is what
`measurable_reindexPopulation` uses to make the reindexing map measurable for an arbitrary `α`;
the definition is the pushforward along that measurable map. -/
