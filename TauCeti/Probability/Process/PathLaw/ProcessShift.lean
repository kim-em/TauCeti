# Process shift operation

The process-level path shift for a process `X : ℕ → Ω → α`, the random path seen from time `m`
onward:

* `processShift X m` — the shifted random path `ω ↦ (n ↦ X (m + n) ω)`, defined as the `m`-fold
  path-space shift `(shift α)^[m]` of the process's path.

The `processCons` / `processTail` operations on sequence-valued random variables, together with
their σ-algebra-contraction lemmas, live in `TauCeti.Probability.Process.Tail.Basic`.

Its exported API is the `@[simp]` coordinate equation `processShift_apply` and the bridges to the
path shift: `processShift_eq_shift_iterate` (composition) and `map_processShift` (measure level).
