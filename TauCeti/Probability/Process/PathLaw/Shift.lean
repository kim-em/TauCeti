# Path-space reindexing and iterates of the one-sided shift

This file records the elementary path-space API for iterating the one-sided shift
`TauCeti.Probability.shift`: the shift-invariant σ-algebra on path space is built on them, as are
comparisons of finite-dimensional path laws after discarding an initial block.

It also records how *shift-fixed sets* behave under time reindexing:
`preimage_reindex_eq_of_preimage_shift_eq_of_eventually_add` shows that a reindexing which is
eventually a translation `n ↦ n + C` leaves every set with `shift α ⁻¹' A = A` unchanged, because
beyond the altered prefix the reindexing agrees with a fixed shift iterate. That is a purely
set-theoretic statement — it assumes no measurability — and it is what lets a block argument move
an invariant event through a reindexing; the complementary fact, that a contractable law is
preserved by such a reindexing, needs strict monotonicity and lives with `ContractableLaw`.

The shift-specialized statements reuse the general time-reindexing path-law lemmas
(`measurable_reindex`, `map_reindex_pathLaw`, `map_reindex_prefixProj_pathLaw`) from
`TauCeti.Probability.Process.PathLaw.Basic`.

/-- **Shift-fixed sets are fixed by an eventually-translating reindexing.** If `φ` is eventually
`n ↦ n + C`, then reindexing by `φ` leaves unchanged every set `A` exactly fixed by the shift,
`shift α ⁻¹' A = A`. No measurability is assumed — this is a set-theoretic identity, and the
`MeasurableSpace.invariants` formulation is the corollary
`preimage_reindex_eq_of_measurableSet_invariants_of_eventually_add`.

Beyond the first `m` coordinates the reindexing agrees with `(shift α)^[C]`, so the identity
`(shift α)^[m] (reindex φ x) = (shift α)^[m + C] x` holds, and exact shift invariance of `A` under
both iterates transfers membership.

Strict monotonicity of `φ` is **not** needed for this set identity; it enters separately, when
`ContractableLaw.measurePreserving_reindex` turns the reindexing into a measure-preserving map. The
two facts are the pair of inputs the Koopman block factorization needs.

The eventual-translation hypothesis is exactly the conclusion recorded by
`StrictMono.exists_strictMono_nat_extending_fin_eventually_add`; this theorem is the consumer of
that clause. -/

/-- **A shift-invariant function is unchanged by such a reindexing**, pointwise.

Each level set `w ⁻¹' {c}` is shift-invariant, so
`preimage_reindex_eq_of_preimage_shift_eq_of_eventually_add` sends the reindexed point into the
same level set as the original. Taking `c = w x` gives the claim.

No measure and no measurable structure appears: this is the raw form. Its invariants-measurable
counterpart, `comp_reindex_apply_eq_of_measurable_invariants_of_eventually_add`, is in
`TauCeti.Probability.Process.Tail.ShiftInvariant`, mirroring how the set-level raw and
invariants-measurable forms are split between the two files. -/
