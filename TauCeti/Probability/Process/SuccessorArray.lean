# Successor arrays of paths and processes

The combinatorial successor-array encoding and its inverse are defined in
`TauCeti.Combinatorics.Enumerative.SuccessorArray`. This file relates that encoding to transition
counts and proves that both directions of the change of variables are measurable.

## Why this is the Diaconis–Freedman decomposition

Markov exchangeability (`TauCeti.Probability.MarkovExchangeable`) says that the law of a finite
path depends only on its initial state and transition counts. The successor array is the change of
variables that reads those counts as occurrence counts in initial segments of its rows. Its
measurability transfers representations of the joint law of `(x 0, successorArray x)` back to the
law of the path.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.Probability.successorProcess`: the successor array of a process, as an array indexed by
  state and visit number.
* `TauCeti.Probability.visitedSuccessorProcess`: the same array with the rows of the states the
  process never visits reset to constants.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Probability.transitionCount_prefixProj`: the transition counts of a prefix are the
  occurrence counts in the rows of the successor array.
* `TauCeti.Probability.measurable_pathOfSuccessors` and
  `TauCeti.Probability.measurable_successorArray`: both directions are measurable.
* `TauCeti.Probability.map_pathOfSuccessors_map_apply_zero_prodMk_successorArray`: every law on
  path space is the image of the joint law of its initial state and successor array.
* `TauCeti.Probability.pathLaw_eq_map_pathOfSuccessors`: the process-level form.

No material is adapted from `cameronfreer/exchangeability`, which treats exchangeable rather than
Markov exchangeable sequences.
