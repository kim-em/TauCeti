# The conditional rectangle common ending for de Finetti

This file supplies the joint-law companion of the mixture rectangle common ending.  To prove that
a measurable random probability measure `ν : Ω → ProbabilityMeasure α` directs a coordinatewise
`μ`-a.e. measurable family, it is enough to verify the expected disintegration on sets of the form

```text
S ×ˢ Set.univ.pi B
```

where `S` is measurable in `ProbabilityMeasure α` and `B` is a measurable finite rectangle in the
block coordinates.  These sets form a π-system generating the joint product σ-algebra, so equality
there extends to the full joint-law identity in `ConditionallyIIDWith`.

## Main results

* `conditionallyIID_of_jointRectangles` — the Layer 1 common ending, at a named directing measure;
* `conditionallyIIDWith_of_measure_inter_blockCylinder_eq_setLIntegral` — a set-integral
  factorization of the mass of a directing-measure event met with a block cylinder, converted here
  into the joint-rectangle identity above. A reusable seam assuming no standard-Borel structure on
  either space: all three de Finetti routes consume it;
* `ConditionallyIIDWith.jointLaw_prod_univ_pi` — the converse rectangle identity;
* `conditionallyIIDWith_iff_forall_jointRectangles` and
  `conditionallyIID_iff_exists_forall_jointRectangles` — characteristic forms for the named and
  existential predicates.

This advances `TauCetiRoadmap/Exchangeability/README.md`, Layer 1, the conditional common ending
`conditionallyIID_of_jointRectangles`.  The joint-law formulation is Kallenberg's conditional
i.i.d. identity (*Probabilistic Symmetries and Invariance Principles*, 2005, §1.1, equation (2)).
The rectangle-extension argument is the joint-space analogue of the common-ending strategy in
`cameronfreer/exchangeability` (`DeFinetti/CommonEnding.lean`, pin
`e0532e59ceff23edab44dda9ab0655debbc9cc22`), adapted to Tau Ceti's stronger
`ConditionallyIIDWith` predicate and Mathlib's `generateFrom_eq_prod`, `generateFrom_pi`, and
π-system API.

/-- **Set-integral common de Finetti ending.** If for every **strictly monotone** block the mass of
a directing-measure event met with a block cylinder is the set-integral of the product of the
witness's evaluations, then the witness directs the process.

`ConditionallyIIDWith` quantifies over arbitrary injective selections, but a caller need only supply
the monotone case: the reduction by sorting happens here. That matches what the proof routes
naturally produce, since a block argument reads disjoint windows in increasing order.

This theorem is, alone among the rectangle endings, stated for a sequence. The obstruction is
inherited rather than intrinsic: the statement is phrased with `blockCylinder`, which
`Process/Cylinder.lean` defines only for `X : ℕ → Ω → α`, and the sorting reduction needs a
linear order on the index — hence `ℕ`. The others quantify over an arbitrary index type.

This is a reusable seam: nothing here mentions how `ν` was built, so a route supplies only its own
factorization identity. The martingale route reaches it from tail conditional laws and consumes it
in `conditionallyIIDWith_of_contractable_pathSpace`; the `L²` route reaches it from its own block
factorization; and the Koopman route conditions on the shift-invariant σ-algebra instead and
consumes it in `ContractableLaw.conditionallyIIDWith_invariantConditionalProbabilityMeasure`.

In particular there is **no** standard-Borel or non-empty hypothesis on either space: those are
needed to *construct* a directing measure, not to recognise one. -/
