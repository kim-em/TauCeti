# The block-cylinder mass, in the shape the common ending consumes

The Koopman route's pieces assembled into the single hypothesis that
`conditionallyIIDWith_of_measure_inter_blockCylinder_eq_setLIntegral` asks for.

The block reduction moves an arbitrary strictly increasing selection onto the prefix; the block
factorization turns the prefix cylinder's mass into an integral of a product of conditional
expectations; naming those as the invariant conditional law and crossing once into `ℝ≥0∞` gives
the identity.

## Main results

* `ContractableLaw.measure_inter_blockCylinder_eq_setLIntegral_of_measurableSet_invariants` — over
  any shift-invariant event, the block-cylinder mass is the integral of the product of the
  invariant conditional law's values.

A consumer wanting the `hcore` hypothesis of
`conditionallyIIDWith_of_measure_inter_blockCylinder_eq_setLIntegral` applies this to a witness
event, whose invariance is `measurable_invariants_invariantConditionalProbabilityMeasure`.

The crossing to `ℝ≥0∞` happens exactly once, here, through the route-neutral
`TauCeti.MeasureTheory.ofReal_integral_prod_toReal_eq_lintegral_prod`; everything upstream is
real-valued. Integrability of the witness product is obtained from the conditional-expectation
product it is a.e. equal to, which avoids needing measurability of the witness evaluation
directly.

## Source

The Koopman route follows Kallenberg's first proof (see References). No material is adapted from
`cameronfreer/exchangeability`; this assembles Tau Ceti's own block reduction, block factorization
and `ℝ≥0∞` bridge.
