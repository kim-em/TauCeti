# The invariant conditional law

On path space, the conditional law of the initial coordinate given the **shift-invariant**
σ-algebra `MeasurableSpace.invariants (shift α)`, bundled as a random probability measure.

It is named a *conditional law*, not a directing measure: this file does not prove that it directs
the process, and Tau Ceti reserves "directing measure" for a witness of `ConditionallyIIDWith`.
That name belongs with the theorem, not here. It is deliberately a separate object from
`directingProbabilityMeasure`, which conditions on the process tail: the two σ-algebras are not
interchangeable — `invariants_shift_le_pathTail` is one-sided, and `invariants_shift_lt_pathTail`
shows the inclusion is strict over `Bool` — so sharing the underlying construction asserts nothing
about the witnesses being equal. Whether they agree a.e. is a separate question, not settled here.

## Main results

* `invariantConditionalProbabilityMeasure` — the witness;
* `invariantConditionalProbabilityMeasure_toMeasure` — its underlying measure, the abstraction
  boundary that lets measure-level operations cross without unfolding the definition;
* `measurable_invariants_invariantConditionalProbabilityMeasure` — measurability relative to the
  invariant σ-algebra;
* `measurable_invariantConditionalProbabilityMeasure` — the ambient corollary;
* `invariantConditionalProbabilityMeasure_ae_eq_condExp` — the characteristic property: evaluated on
  a measurable set, it is a version of the conditional expectation of that set's indicator at
  coordinate `0`, given the invariant σ-algebra.

Nothing here proves that this witness directs the process; that is the Koopman block
factorization, which is not part of this file.

Adapted from `DeFinetti/DirectingMeasure/Basic.lean`, which carries the attribution to
`cameronfreer/exchangeability` (`DeFinetti/ViaMartingale/DirectingMeasure.lean`, pin
`e0532e59ceff23edab44dda9ab0655debbc9cc22`). The specialization here is the conditioning
σ-algebra: that file conditions on `tailProcess X`, this one on
`MeasurableSpace.invariants (shift α)`, with the shared bundling factored through
`Kernel.probabilityMeasure`.

/-- The **invariant conditional law**: the conditional law of the initial coordinate `x 0` given
the shift-invariant σ-algebra, bundled as a `ProbabilityMeasure`.

The invariant σ-algebra is a *non-ambient* `MeasurableSpace` on `ℕ → α`, so it must be pinned at
every layer — both on the bundling wrapper and on the `condDistrib` whose fibres it bundles. -/

This is the abstraction boundary: downstream measure-level reasoning goes through this lemma rather

/-- **Characteristic property.** Evaluated on a measurable set `B`, the invariant conditional law
is a version of the conditional expectation of `𝟙_B ∘ (· 0)` given the shift-invariant σ-algebra.

This is what identifies the witness: everything the Koopman route needs to know about it is that
its evaluations are these conditional expectations. -/
