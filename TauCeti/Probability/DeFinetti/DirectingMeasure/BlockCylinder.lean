# The mass of a directing-measure event met with a block cylinder

One lemma, the integration step shared by the routes that condition on the **tail** σ-algebra:

```text
μ ((ν ⁻¹' S) ∩ blockCylinder X k B) = ∫⁻ ω in ν ⁻¹' S, ∏ i, directingMeasure μ X ω (B i) ∂μ
```

given the conditional factorization of the block along `k`. That factorization is a **hypothesis**,
not a conclusion: this file proves none of it, and so depends on no route that establishes it. Each
route supplies its own — the martingale route from `TailFactorization`, the `L²` route from
`ViaL2/BlockFactorization.lean` — and both then instantiate this lemma. The Koopman route
conditions on the shift-invariant σ-algebra and builds a different witness, so it does not reach
this file at all.

That is the whole point of stating it this way. The routes are required to stay independent at the
level of imports, so the shared material has to be the part that *neither* proves: here, the
bookkeeping that turns an a.e. identity of conditional expectations into an identity of measures.

The argument is three steps. A directing-measure event is tail-measurable, so testing the
factorization against it is `setIntegral_condExp`. The cylinder's mass is the integral of its
indicator, which is `integral_blockIndicatorProd` read against the restricted measure. And the
conversion to `ℝ≥0∞` happens once, at the end, via
`ofReal_integral_eq_lintegral_prod_directingMeasure`.

The result feeds `conditionallyIIDWith_of_measure_inter_blockCylinder_eq_setLIntegral`, whose
`hcore` hypothesis it is in exactly this shape.

/-- **The mass of a directing-measure event met with a block cylinder**, given the conditional
factorization of that block along `k`.

The factorization is a hypothesis, so this lemma is neutral between the routes that establish it.
Note that neither `Contractable μ X` nor `[StandardBorelSpace Ω]` appears: both are needed only to
*produce* `hfac`, never to integrate it. -/
