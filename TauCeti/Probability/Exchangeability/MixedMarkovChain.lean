# Mixtures of Markov chains

A process `X : ℕ → Ω → α` on a countable state space is a **mixture of Markov chains** when its
finite-path `μ`-masses are integrals of Markov-chain path masses against `μ`: there is a measurable
initial-law witness `ν : Ω → ProbabilityMeasure α` and a measurable transition-matrix witness
`κ : Ω → α → ProbabilityMeasure α` with

```text
prefixLaw μ X (n + 1) {w} = ∫⁻ ω, ν ω {w 0} * ∏ i, κ ω (w i.castSucc) {w i.succ} ∂μ
```

for every finite path `w`. `MixedMarkovChainWith μ X ν κ` names the pair of witnesses, and
`MixedMarkovChain μ X` is the existential wrapper. The naming and the witness/existential split
follow `MixedIIDWith` / `MixedIID`. This notion contains mixed i.i.d. processes: an i.i.d. mixture
is the mixture of Markov chains whose rows do not depend on the current state
(`MixedIIDWith.mixedMarkovChainWith`).

⚠ Like `MixedIIDWith`, this is a property of the **unconditional** finite path laws only. It says
nothing about the joint law of `(ν, κ, X)`, so it is not a conditional-independence statement, and
the witnesses are not asserted to be unique. The conditional strengthening — conditionally on
`(ν, κ)` the process is a Markov chain with that initial law and that transition matrix — is the
analogue of `ConditionallyIIDWith` and is deliberately not what is defined here.

This is the class in the conclusion of the Diaconis–Freedman representation theorem: a recurrent
Markov exchangeable process is a mixture of Markov chains. This file supplies the class together
with the **easy direction** of that theorem, `MixedMarkovChainWith.markovExchangeable`: every
mixture of Markov chains is Markov exchangeable. The mechanism is the one that makes the initial
state together with the transition counts sufficient for a Markov-chain path mass — the
transition-product factor depends on the path only through its transition counts
(`TauCeti.prod_eq_of_transitionCount_eq`) — applied inside the mixing integral, where it holds
pointwise in the mixing variable.

The class is strictly larger than the mixed i.i.d. one: the deterministic 3-cycle of
`TauCeti/Probability/Exchangeability/ThreeCycle.lean` is a Markov chain, hence a mixture of Markov
chains (`threeCycle_mixedMarkovChain`), but is not exchangeable and so not mixed i.i.d.

The class is also closed under **gluing along a countable partition**
(`mixedMarkovChainWith_of_forall_cond`): if the process is a mixture of Markov chains under each
conditional measure `μ[|f ⁻¹' {b}]` on a fibre of positive mass of a random variable `f` with
countably many values, then it is one under `μ`, with the witnesses on the fibre of `ω` read off at
`ω`. This follows from the law of total probability over the fibres
(`ProbabilityTheory.sum_meas_smul_cond_fiber_of_countable`), since a fibre of mass zero contributes
nothing to the finite path masses. The case `f = X 0` is what takes the Diaconis–Freedman
representation from a process starting at a fixed state to one with a random initial state: the
conditional representations at the individual initial states glue to a single pair of witnesses.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.Probability.MixedMarkovChainWith`: the mixture identity with named witnesses.
* `TauCeti.Probability.MixedMarkovChain`: its existential wrapper.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Probability.MixedMarkovChainWith.prefixLaw_singleton_eq_lintegral_prod_pow`: the
  initial state and transition counts of a path are sufficient for its `μ`-mass.
* `TauCeti.Probability.MixedMarkovChainWith.markovExchangeable`: a mixture of Markov chains is
  Markov exchangeable — the easy direction of Diaconis–Freedman.
* `TauCeti.Probability.mixedMarkovChainWith_const_of_prefixLaw_singleton_eq`: a single Markov chain
  is the degenerate mixture.
* `TauCeti.Probability.MixedIIDWith.mixedMarkovChainWith`: a mixed i.i.d. process is a mixture of
  Markov chains with state-independent rows.
* `TauCeti.Probability.mixedMarkovChainWith_of_forall_cond` and
  `TauCeti.Probability.mixedMarkovChain_of_forall_cond`: a process that is a mixture of Markov
  chains conditionally on each positive-mass value of a countably-valued random variable is a
  mixture of Markov chains.
* `TauCeti.Probability.markovChainLaw_mixedMarkovChainWith`: the homogeneous Markov chain of an
  initial law and a transition kernel is the degenerate mixture with those constant witnesses, and
  `TauCeti.Probability.markovChainLaw_markovExchangeable` is its Markov exchangeability. These make
  the two classes non-vacuous at an arbitrary transition kernel, rather than only at the hypothesis
  that some product form of the finite path laws holds.

finite path is the integral against `μ` of its Markov-chain path mass built from `ν ω` and `κ ω`.
The countability and measurable-singleton conjuncts restrict this singleton-mass formulation to
discrete state spaces, matching `MarkovExchangeable`, where it is non-vacuous and determines the
finite path laws. Bundled alongside, as in `MarkovExchangeable`, are the regularity conjuncts the
mixture identity is stated against: the process is coordinatewise a.e. measurable, and both
witnesses are measurable (`ν`, and each row `ω ↦ κ ω a`). -/
