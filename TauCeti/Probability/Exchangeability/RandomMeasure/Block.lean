# Finite block marginals of an invariant random path measure

A law on random probability measures on path space may be invariant under coordinate
permutations even though a sampled measure is not itself exchangeable. `RandomMeasure.Basic`
extracts the resulting exchangeable sequence of one-coordinate marginals. Here the same argument
is carried out for every positive finite block width.

For `m > 0`, `blockMarginals P m i` is the pushforward of `P` to the `i`-th consecutive block of
`m` coordinates. Permuting those blocks extends canonically to a permutation of all path
coordinates by keeping the within-block position fixed. Thus an invariant law on random path
measures makes the block marginals fully exchangeable. Applying the measurable injective code for
probability measures and de Finetti gives a conditional-i.i.d. factorization for every fixed
width.

These block marginals retain each finite-dimensional marginal of the random path law, rather than
only its one-coordinate marginals. A block of width `n * m` canonically splits into `n` consecutive
blocks of width `m` along `TauCeti.MeasureTheory.blockSplitEquiv`; the restriction identities below
make the finite-dimensional systems at different widths compatible. They are the input for
comparing the conditional directing laws obtained at those widths. Conversely, the coded zeroth
block marginals at all positive widths determine the original path measure, even when their
equalities hold on width-dependent almost-sure sets.

## Main definitions and results

* `MeasureTheory.ProbabilityMeasure.blockMarginals` -- the sequence of consecutive
  `m`-coordinate marginals;
* `MeasureTheory.ProbabilityMeasure.codedBlockMarginals` -- those marginals in the canonical
  measurable code;
* `MeasureTheory.ProbabilityMeasure.map_blockSplitEquiv_blockMarginals_mul` -- the joint law of
  the split large block is the law of the corresponding consecutive small blocks;
* `MeasureTheory.ProbabilityMeasure.map_blockRestriction_blockMarginals_mul` -- each component of
  that joint law is the corresponding small block marginal;
* `MeasureTheory.ProbabilityMeasure.eq_of_codedBlockMarginals_zero_eq` -- all coded positive-width
  blocks at the origin determine the path measure;
* `TauCeti.Probability.fullyExchangeable_blockMarginals_of_invariant` -- invariance of the random
  path-measure law makes the block marginals fully exchangeable;
* `TauCeti.Probability.conditionallyIID_codedBlockMarginals_of_invariant` -- their conditional
  de Finetti factorization.
