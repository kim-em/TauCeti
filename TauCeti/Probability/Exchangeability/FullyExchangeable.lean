# Full exchangeability and path-law bridges

The Layer 0 bridges between finite exchangeability, full exchangeability, and path-law
endomorphisms:

* `exchangeable_iff_fullyExchangeable` — finite exchangeability (invariance under permutations of
  each `Fin n`) is equivalent to full exchangeability (invariance under all permutations of `ℕ`)
  for a process with a.e. measurable coordinates under a finite measure.
* `FullyExchangeable.measurePreserving_shift` — a fully exchangeable process has a shift-invariant
  path law, the bridge from symmetry to the Koopman/ergodic lane.
* `fullyExchangeable_iff_forall_map_permReindex_pathLaw` and
  `fullyExchangeable_iff_forall_measurePreserving_permReindex` — full exchangeability is
  equivalently invariance, or measure preservation, of the path law under every time-permutation
  reindexing map.

These bridges live together because they all identify the process-level symmetry
`FullyExchangeable μ X` with corresponding path-law invariance statements. They are thin: they
reuse the Layer 0 API and Mathlib — finite-marginal uniqueness (`FiniteMarginals`), the
contractability bridge (`Contractability`), generic path-law reindexing, and Mathlib's finite
permutation extension theorem — rather than new measure theory.

These declarations are adapted from the `cameronfreer/exchangeability` Layer 0 sources pinned at
`e0532e59ceff23edab44dda9ab0655debbc9cc22`, with Tau Ceti API names and hypotheses.
