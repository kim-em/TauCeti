# The path law of a mixed i.i.d. process

A mixed i.i.d. process has, as its **path law**, a mixture of infinite product measures: for a
mixing representative `ν`,

```text
pathLaw μ X = ∫ P^{⊗ℕ} d(μ.map ν)(P)
```

written in the `Measure.bind` idiom.

## Main results

* `pathLaw_eq_bind_infinitePi_of_mixedIIDWith` — the representation, for an arbitrary mixing
  representative.
* `mixedIID_mixingLaw_eq_of_pathLaw_eq` — the mixing law is a function of the path law alone.
* `mixedIID_mixingLaw_unique` — the mixing law `μ.map ν` is determined by the process.
* `MixedIID.existsUnique_mixingLaw` — a mixed i.i.d. process under a probability law has a unique
  probability mixing law in the infinite-product representation.

The witness-level representation and uniqueness results need only `[IsFiniteMeasure μ]`,
a.e.-measurable coordinates, and the witness. `MixedIID.existsUnique_mixingLaw` assumes
`[IsProbabilityMeasure μ]` only so that the unique mixing law can be bundled as a
`ProbabilityMeasure`. No standard-Borel hypothesis appears: that is the cost of *supplying* a
canonical witness, not of using one, so this file carries no de Finetti dependency.

## Implementation

`MixedIIDWith` constrains only the *finite* blocks, so the work is the passage from finite blocks to
the whole path. The two sides are compared through their finite-dimensional prefix marginals via
`measure_eq_of_prefixProj_map_eq`: on the left `map_prefixProj_pathLaw` and the block identity, on
the right `map_bind` to push the marginal inside the mixture, `map_prefixProj_infinitePi_const` to
recognise each prefix marginal of an infinite power as the corresponding finite power, and
`bind_map` to re-index the mixture over `μ` rather than over `μ.map ν`.

This advances `TauCetiRoadmap/Exchangeability/README.md`, Layer 6, the directing-measure API bullet
asking for the mixture-of-product-measures form. That bullet also asks for `π` to be the *unique*
law of `ν`, which `mixedIID_mixingLaw_unique` now supplies: the mixture representation turns two
witnesses into the same `Measure.bind`, and injectivity of `π ↦ π.bind (P ↦ P^{⊗ℕ})`
(`Measure.ext_of_bind_infinitePi_eq`) identifies the mixing laws. The roadmap name
`deFinetti_mixture`, which derives the unique representation from exchangeability rather than
assuming a witness, lives in `TauCeti.Probability.DeFinetti.Representation`.

/-- **The mixing law is a function of the path law.** Two mixed i.i.d. processes with the same path
law — on possibly different sample spaces — have mixing representatives with the same law.

This is the sharp form of mixing-law uniqueness: the mixture representation writes the path law as
`π.bind (P ↦ P^{⊗ℕ})` for `π = μ.map ν`, and that assignment is injective
(`Measure.ext_of_bind_infinitePi_eq`), so the path law already determines `π`. Comparing two
witnesses for one and the same process (`mixedIID_mixingLaw_unique`) is the special case
`hpath = rfl`. -/

/-- **Uniqueness of the mixing law.** Two mixing representatives for the same process induce the
same law on `ProbabilityMeasure α`.

Only the *law* `μ.map ν` is unique, not the witness. For a nondegenerate mixing law an independent
copy of a mixing representative is another one, so no witness-level a.e.-equality theorem can
conclude `ν =ᵐ[μ] ν'` from `MixedIIDWith` alone; a.e. uniqueness of the witness belongs to the
conditional predicate (`conditionallyIID_ae_unique`).

*Finiteness* of `μ` is load-bearing rather than decorative: for an infinite base measure, distinct
mixing measures can produce identical `∞`-valued finite-dimensional mixtures, so mixing-law
uniqueness fails at the hypothesis-light generality the definitions otherwise enjoy.

Normalization, however, is not needed. The roadmap states this target with
`[IsProbabilityMeasure μ]`, but the justification it gives only separates finite from infinite base
measures, and the proof goes through for any finite `μ`. -/

/-- **Existence and uniqueness of the mixing law.** A mixed i.i.d. process under a probability
law has a unique probability measure `π` on `ProbabilityMeasure α` such that its path law is
the `π`-mixture of the infinite product measures `P^{⊗ℕ}`.

This identifies the mixing law intrinsically from the path law, rather than merely comparing the
pushforwards of two supplied mixing representatives as `mixedIID_mixingLaw_unique` does. -/
