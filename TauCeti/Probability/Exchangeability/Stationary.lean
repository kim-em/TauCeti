# Exchangeable laws are stationary

This file records the Layer 0 stationarity bridge from the Exchangeability roadmap: a finitely
exchangeable process has a shift-invariant path law.  The existing implication
`Exchangeable.contractable` gives the exchangeability-to-contractability bridge.  The lemmas here
first expose the shift-stationarity consequences at the natural `Contractable` level, then provide
thin `Exchangeable`-named wrappers for downstream code that starts from exchangeability.

The bridge is stated for the one-sided shift and its iterates.  The final `processShift` form
packages the same invariance at the process-law level.
