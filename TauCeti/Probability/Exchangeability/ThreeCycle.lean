# A stationary process that is not exchangeable: the deterministic 3-cycle

This file discharges a worked example of the Exchangeability roadmap
(`TauCetiRoadmap/Exchangeability/README.md`, "Worked examples"):

> A stationary non-reversible finite-state Markov chain — for instance the deterministic
> 3-cycle with uniform stationary law — is shift-invariant but not exchangeable, since the law
> of `(X₀, X₁)` differs from that of `(X₁, X₀)`. This keeps stationarity, shift-invariance, and
> exchangeability distinct.

Take the base space `Ω = ZMod 3` with its uniform probability law `threeCycleMeasure =
ProbabilityTheory.uniformOn Set.univ`, and the deterministic rotation process `threeCycle n ω =
ω + n`. Starting from a uniform state and stepping by the 3-cycle, the process is stationary:
its path law is invariant under the one-sided shift
(`threeCycle_measurePreserving_shift`), because shifting the sample path of `ω` gives the sample
path of `ω + 1`, and the uniform law is translation invariant.

It is a deterministic Markov chain, hence a mixture of Markov chains
(`threeCycle_mixedMarkovChain`) and so Markov exchangeable (`threeCycle_markovExchangeable`); since
it is not exchangeable, this is also the example showing that `Exchangeable` is strictly stronger
than `MarkovExchangeable`, and — through `threeCycle_not_mixedIID` — that `MixedIID` is strictly
stronger than `MixedMarkovChain`.

It is, however, neither exchangeable (`threeCycle_not_exchangeable`) nor contractable
(`threeCycle_not_contractable`): the pair `(X₀, X₁) = (ω, ω + 1)` lands in
`{(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0)}`, so swapping the two coordinates — or reading off the pair `(X₀, X₂)`
instead — produces a different two-dimensional law. This separates stationarity and
shift-invariance from the symmetry notions, as the roadmap example asks.

The example uses the Layer 0 API (`Exchangeable`, `Contractable`, `pathLaw`, `blockLaw`, `shift`)
together with the Layer 8 `MarkovExchangeable` / `MixedMarkovChain` interface and `MixedIID`, and
Mathlib's translation invariance of the counting measure on a group
(`MeasureTheory.map_add_right_eq_self`) and its `MeasureTheory.diracProba`; it needs no material
from `cameronfreer/exchangeability`.
