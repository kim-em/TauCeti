# Extreme exchangeable laws

The extreme points of the convex set of exchangeable probability measures on `ℕ → α` are exactly
the i.i.d. product laws. The main theorem `exchangeable_extreme_iff_iid` states this using Mathlib's
`Set.extremePoints` for the natural `ℝ≥0∞`-module structure on measures.

The two directions expose the two classical mechanisms. An i.i.d. product law is ergodic for the
one-sided shift: shift-invariant events are exchangeable events, so the Hewitt–Savage zero-one law
applies. Mathlib's `Ergodic.mem_extremePoints` then makes it extreme among all shift-invariant
probability measures, hence among the smaller set of exchangeable ones. Conversely, de Finetti's
unique mixture representation writes an exchangeable law as

```text
∫ P^{⊗ℕ} dπ(P).
```

If a measurable set has mixing mass strictly between zero and one, conditioning `π` on the set and
its complement gives a nontrivial convex decomposition into exchangeable laws. Extremality rules
this out, mixture injectivity identifies the conditional mixing law with `π`, and therefore `π` is
zero-one. `IsZeroOneMeasure.exists_eq_dirac_probabilityMeasure` turns this into `π = δ_P`.

This proves the Layer 6 extreme-point corollary and the public
`exchangeable_extreme_iff_iid` target in Layer 7 of
`TauCetiRoadmap/Exchangeability/README.md`.

## Main results

* `ergodic_shift_infinitePi_const` — an i.i.d. product law is ergodic for the one-sided shift.
* `infinitePi_mem_extremePoints_exchangeable` — an i.i.d. product law is an extreme exchangeable
  law. This direction needs no standard Borel hypothesis, so it is stated over an arbitrary
  measurable space.
* `exchangeable_extreme_iff_iid` — the extreme exchangeable probability laws are exactly the
  i.i.d. product laws.

No material is adapted from `cameronfreer/exchangeability`, which does not contain this
extreme-point result. The proof reuses Mathlib's characterization of ergodic measures as extreme
points and Tau Ceti's de Finetti mixture injectivity rather than reproducing either argument.

/-- An i.i.d. infinite product law is ergodic for the one-sided shift.

The shift-invariant σ-algebra is contained in the exchangeable σ-algebra, and the coordinate
process is independent and identically distributed under the product law, so Hewitt–Savage makes
every shift-invariant event null or conull. -/

/-- **An extreme exchangeable law is i.i.d.** De Finetti writes the law as a mixture over
`ProbabilityMeasure α`; extremality forces the mixing measure to be a zero-one law, hence a Dirac
mass, and the mixture collapses to a single infinite product. -/
