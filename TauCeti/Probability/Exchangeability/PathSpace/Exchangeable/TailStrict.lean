# The path tail is strictly smaller than the exchangeable sigma-algebra

For paths whose state-space σ-algebra is nontrivial, this file proves the strict comparison

`pathTail alpha < exchangeableSigma alpha`.

The witness is the event that a path visits a fixed measurable set at finitely many, evenly many
coordinates.  Every time permutation preserves the cardinality of that finite visit set, so the
event is exchangeable.  It is not a tail event: changing coordinate zero alone changes the parity
without changing any coordinate from time one onward.

This completes the strict comparison between the path tail and exchangeable sigma-algebras in
Layer 2 of the exchangeability roadmap.  Together with `invariants_shift_lt_pathTail`, it gives
the strict chain

`invariants (shift Bool) < pathTail Bool < exchangeableSigma Bool`

under the hypotheses of the two results.

## Main results

* `pathTail_lt_exchangeableSigma` -- the path tail is a proper sub-sigma-algebra of the
  exchangeable sigma-algebra.
* `invariants_shift_lt_exchangeableSigma` -- for `Bool`-valued paths, so is the shift-invariant
  sigma-algebra.

/-- **The path tail sigma-algebra is a proper sub-sigma-algebra of the exchangeable
sigma-algebra.**  This holds whenever the state-space σ-algebra is nontrivial.

The reverse inclusion fails because the exchangeable event that a path visits a proper measurable
set at finitely many, evenly many coordinates is sensitive to changing one coordinate, whereas
every tail event is insensitive to every finite prefix. -/
