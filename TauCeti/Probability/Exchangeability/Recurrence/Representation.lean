# A recurrent Markov exchangeable process is a mixture of processes with i.i.d. excursions

`Recurrence.Reconstruction` establishes that the path law of a recurrent process is the image of
its excursion law under concatenation.  This file supplies the other half: for a **Markov
exchangeable** process the excursion process is exchangeable, hence conditionally i.i.d., so that
excursion law is a mixture.  Combining the two gives the representation

```text
pathLaw μ X = (deFinettiBarycenter π).map (pathOfExcursions a₀)
```

for a probability measure `π` on laws of finite words: draw an excursion law `P` from `π`, draw
excursions i.i.d. from `P`, and concatenate them
(`TauCeti.Probability.MarkovExchangeable.exists_pathLaw_eq_map_deFinettiBarycenter`). The mixing
law is carried on laws of words that almost surely avoid `a₀`
(`TauCeti.Probability.MarkovExchangeable.exists_pathLaw_eq_map_deFinettiBarycenter`, second
conjunct), so the concatenated path really has the drawn words as its excursions.

This is Diaconis and Freedman's decomposition step for Markov exchangeability: it exhibits a
recurrent Markov exchangeable process as a mixture of **regenerative** processes. What it does not
yet say is that the random excursion law is the excursion law of a Markov chain, which is the
remaining input of the Diaconis–Freedman representation
`TauCeti.Probability.MixedMarkovChain`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Probability.MarkovExchangeable.conditionallyIID_excursionProcess`: de Finetti applied to
  the excursion process of a recurrent Markov exchangeable process.
* `TauCeti.Probability.ConditionallyIIDWith.ae_measure_setOf_mem_eq_zero_of_excursionProcess`: a
  directing measure of an excursion process almost surely charges no word through the base state.
* `TauCeti.Probability.MarkovExchangeable.exists_pathLaw_eq_map_deFinettiBarycenter`: **a recurrent
  Markov exchangeable process is a mixture of processes with i.i.d. excursions.**

/-! ## De Finetti for the excursions -/

/-- **De Finetti for the excursions of a recurrent Markov exchangeable process.** The excursions
away from the initial state are conditionally i.i.d. finite words.

The value space needs no hypothesis: over a countable state space the finite words form a countable
discrete space, which is standard Borel and nonempty. -/

/-- **A directing measure of an excursion process charges no word through the base state.** An
excursion never visits the state it is an excursion from, so almost every mixing representative of
the excursion process gives the words through `a₀` mass zero. -/

/-! ## The representation -/

/-- **A recurrent Markov exchangeable process is a mixture of processes with i.i.d. excursions.**
Its path law is obtained by drawing an excursion law `P` from a mixing law `π`, drawing excursions
i.i.d. from `P`, and concatenating them. The mixing law is carried on laws that almost surely avoid
the base state, so the concatenated path has the drawn words as its excursions.

This is the decomposition step of the Diaconis–Freedman representation. Identifying the random
excursion law with the excursion law of a Markov chain, which upgrades this to
`TauCeti.Probability.MixedMarkovChain`, is a separate statement. -/
