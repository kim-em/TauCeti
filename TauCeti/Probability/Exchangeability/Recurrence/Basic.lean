# Exchangeable and contractable processes are recurrent

A contractable process has a shift-invariant path law, so on a countable state space the
Poincaré recurrence theorem of `TauCeti.Probability.Recurrent` applies to it. Exchangeable
processes are contractable, so they are recurrent too.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Probability.Contractable.recurrent` and
  `TauCeti.Probability.Exchangeable.recurrent` — contractable and exchangeable processes on a
  countable state space are recurrent.
