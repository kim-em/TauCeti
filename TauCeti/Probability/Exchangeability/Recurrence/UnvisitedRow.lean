# A recurrent Markov exchangeable process whose successor array is not row exchangeable

The Diaconis–Freedman representation of a Markov exchangeable process passes through its
**successor array** `TauCeti.Probability.successorProcess`, whose `(a, k)`-entry is the state
reached right after the `k`-th visit to `a`. The change of variables back from a row exchangeable
array to a mixture of Markov chains is `TauCeti.Probability.mixedMarkovChain_of_rowExchangeable`,
and one array it accepts is that successor array. This file shows that recurrence and Markov
exchangeability do not make the successor array row exchangeable, and exhibits an obstruction to
it; that is why the Diaconis–Freedman representation
`TauCeti.Probability.MarkovExchangeable.mixedMarkovChain` passes through the visited successor
array `TauCeti.Probability.visitedSuccessorProcess` instead, whose unvisited rows are constant.

The obstruction is not the reordering of genuine transitions but the junk rows. A state the
process never visits has no genuine successors, so every one of its visit times is `Nat.nth`'s
junk index `0`; the whole row is therefore read off at time zero, every entry being `x 1`, and by
`TauCeti.successorArray_eq_successorArray_zero_of_forall_ne` it is constant and equal to the cell
`(x 0, 0)`. Every successor array therefore satisfies the tie

```text
successorArray x a k = successorArray x (x 0) 0    (a never visited)
```

whereas a permutation of the row `x 0` moves the right-hand side while leaving the left-hand side
where it is. `TauCeti.Probability.Recurrent` constrains only the states a process *does* visit, so
it does not exclude this.

To turn that into a counterexample take the three-letter alphabet `Fin 3` and let
`spareStateProcess` be the sequence of coordinates of a fair coin sequence in the two letters `0`
and `1`; the letter `2` is spare and is almost surely never taken. Being i.i.d. the process is
exchangeable (`spareStateProcess_exchangeable`), hence Markov exchangeable
(`spareStateProcess_markovExchangeable`) and recurrent (`spareStateProcess_recurrent`). Yet
swapping the first two entries of the row of the letter `0` — a permutation family of finite
support — changes the law of its successor array
(`spareStateProcess_not_rowExchangeable_successorProcess`), because the swap breaks the tie above
on the event that the path begins `0, 0, 1, 1` *and* never takes the spare letter. That event has
probability `16⁻¹`, the probability of the opening alone, because avoiding the spare letter is
almost sure.

Only one of the two cells the tie involves is one the consumer of the array reads:
`TauCeti.eqOn_iff_successorArray_visitCell` describes a finite path event through the cells a
reference path designates, and those lie in visited rows, so the spare row's cell `(2, 0)` is
never among them, while the cell `(x 0, 0)` it is tied to is a genuine successor cell.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Probability.spareStateProcess_exchangeable`,
  `TauCeti.Probability.spareStateProcess_markovExchangeable` and
  `TauCeti.Probability.spareStateProcess_recurrent` — the example satisfies the Diaconis–Freedman
  hypotheses.
* `TauCeti.Probability.spareStateProcess_not_rowExchangeable_successorProcess` — its successor
  array is nevertheless not row exchangeable.
