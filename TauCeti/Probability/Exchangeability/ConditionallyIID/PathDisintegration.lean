# The full-path joint disintegration

`ConditionallyIIDWith μ X ν` constrains the joint law of `(ν, block)` along each *finite* selection
of coordinates. This file upgrades that to the whole path at once: the joint law of the directing
measure together with the entire process is the disintegration `∫ δ_{ν ω} ⊗ (ν ω)^{⊗ℕ} dμ(ω)`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Probability.ConditionallyIIDWith.jointPathLaw_eq_iidMixtureLaw`
* `TauCeti.Probability.ConditionallyIIDWith.jointPathLaw_eq_of_pathLaw_eq` — the joint law depends
  on the process only through its path law.

## Implementation

The right-hand side is not a new construction: `iidMixtureLaw (μ.map ν) id` is the canonical
two-stage law of `ConditionallyIID.Construct` — draw a probability measure from the mixing law
`μ.map ν`, then sample i.i.d. from it, keeping the drawn measure as a coordinate. So the theorem
says the abstract conditional predicate is *exactly* realised by that generative construction, which
is a stronger statement than naming a bespoke disintegration measure would be.

Both measures live on `ProbabilityMeasure α × (ℕ → α)`, and the proof identifies them prefix by
prefix. For the joint law that prefix marginal is the defining identity of `ConditionallyIIDWith`
at the selection `Fin n → ℕ`, which is
`map_prefixProjPair_jointPathLaw_eq_disintegration`. For the mixture law it is
`map_prefixProjPair_iidMixtureLaw` — a general fact about `iidMixtureLaw`, and so kept with the
construction in `ConditionallyIID/Construct.lean` — proved fibrewise: over each point `t` of the
mixing law the
fibre `δ_t ⊗ (P t)^{⊗ℕ}` projects to `δ_t ⊗ (P t)^{⊗ Fin n}`, which is
`map_infinitePi_pair_block` at the prefix selection — the tag `t` and the sampled law `P t`
differ there, which is why that lemma carries an arbitrary tag. Instantiating at the identity
kernel and pushing the bind back along `ν` makes the two prefix marginals agree, and
`measure_eq_of_prefixProjPair_map_eq` promotes the agreement to equality of the full measures.

That last step is where the paired prefix maps `prefixProjPair` earn their keep. Mathlib's
`IsProjectiveLimit` is stated for pure dependent products `∀ i, α i`, so it does not apply to a
product with a fixed first factor; `measure_eq_of_prefixProjPair_map_eq` instead replicates the
first factor at every coordinate to reduce to the honest path case.

The path-level form is what downstream work consumes — empirical measures as objects, the
affine/barycenter representation, and ergodic decomposition all read the joint law of `(ν, X)` in
one piece rather than block by block.

/-- **The joint law of a directing measure and a path is a function of the path law.** Two
conditionally i.i.d. processes with the same path law — on possibly different sample spaces — have
directing measures jointly distributed with the path in the same way.

This is the conditional-side companion of `mixedIID_mixingLaw_eq_of_pathLaw_eq`, and is strictly
stronger than it: the mixing law is the first marginal of the joint law. It fails for a mere
mixing representative, whose coupling with the path is not determined — an independent copy of a
directing measure witnesses `MixedIIDWith` with a different joint law.

The proof is the full-path disintegration read twice: each joint law is the canonical two-stage
law `iidMixtureLaw` of its mixing law, and equal path laws give equal mixing laws. -/
