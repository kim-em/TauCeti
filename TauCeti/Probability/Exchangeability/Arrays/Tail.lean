# Tail σ-algebras of arrays

This file defines the corner tail of an array: the events readable from entries `X (i, j)` with
both indices arbitrarily large. It is the two-dimensional analogue of the tail σ-algebra of a
process, cutting both index axes at the same time, and it is the σ-algebra the zero-one law for a
dissociated array in `Arrays.ZeroOne` is stated for. Cutting both axes is what dissociation asks
for: two square blocks are independent only when their index sets are disjoint, so a one-axis cut
would not do.

The corner tail need not be the tail of the diagonal process `arrayDiag X`; it contains it
(`tailProcess_arrayDiag_le_arrayTail`) and may additionally read off-diagonal entries above the
cutoff.

These definitions support the exchangeable-arrays milestone of
`TauCetiRoadmap/Exchangeability/README.md`, Layer 8.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.Probability.arrayTailFamily` — the σ-algebra of the entries with both indices at least
  `n`;
* `TauCeti.Probability.arrayTail` — the tail σ-algebra of an array, the infimum of the tail family.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Probability.arrayTailFamily_le_iff` and `TauCeti.Probability.le_arrayTail_iff` — the
  universal properties of the two σ-algebras;
* `TauCeti.Probability.arrayTailFamily_antitone` — the tail family decreases;
* `TauCeti.Probability.arrayTailFamily_eq_iSup_Icc` — finite corners exhaust a member of the tail
  family;
* `TauCeti.Probability.arrayTail_le_ambient` — the array tail is a sub-σ-algebra of the ambient one
  as soon as the entries beyond some cutoff are measurable;
* `TauCeti.Probability.blockSigma_arrayDiag_le_blockSigma_prod_self` — a block of diagonal entries
  is read by the square block over the same index set;
* `TauCeti.Probability.tailProcess_arrayDiag_le_arrayTail` — the tail of the diagonal process is an
  array tail event.
