# Quantitative finite de Finetti approximation

Let `x : κ → α` be a nonempty finite population. Its empirical distribution is the pushforward
of the uniform law on `κ` by `x`. Sampling `ι` entries from that distribution independently is
therefore the same as choosing a uniform map `ι → κ` and reading the selected entries of `x`.

For a random population with law `ρ`, `sampleWithReplacement ρ` draws the population and,
independently, a uniform map `ι → κ`, and reads the selected entries. It is the same
`samplePopulation` construction as `sampleWithoutReplacement ρ`, which instead draws a uniform
injective map; when `κ` is nonempty, by the previous paragraph it is the mixture over `ρ` of the
finite product laws of the empirical distributions. The law `sampleWithoutReplacement ρ` already
represents every shorter marginal of a finite exchangeable process. The collision coupling between
uniform maps and uniform injective maps consequently gives, for every measurable event `A`,

```text
prefixLaw μ X m A ≤ sampleWithReplacement (prefixLaw μ X n) A + choose(m, 2) / n
sampleWithReplacement (prefixLaw μ X n) A ≤ prefixLaw μ X m A + choose(m, 2) / n.
```

Thus, for `n > 0`, every `m`-coordinate marginal of an `n`-exchangeable process is quantitatively
approximated by a mixture of `m`-fold product measures of empirical distributions; for
`n = m = 0` both sides are the shared sampling construction on the empty index type. The bound is
stated eventwise rather than through a new total-variation definition; in terms of Mathlib's
`SignedMeasure.totalVariation`, whose mass on the whole space is the signed-measure norm
`‖P - Q‖` (twice `sup_A |P A - Q A|`), it gives `‖P - Q‖ ≤ 2 * choose(m, 2) / n`.

/-- Sampling with replacement from a random finite population.

First draw a population `x : κ → α` with law `ρ`; independently draw the indices `k i : κ`,
`i : ι`, independently and uniformly; then return the sample `i ↦ x (k i)`. This is
`samplePopulation` along the `ι`-fold product of the uniform law on `κ`, which is the uniform law
on all index maps (`sampleWithReplacement_eq_samplePopulation_uniformOn`): the same construction
as `sampleWithoutReplacement` without the injectivity constraint. If `κ` is empty but `ι` is not,
no index map exists, and Mathlib's `uniformOn` convention makes this the zero measure.

The sample index is finite because the selection law is a finite product. -/

The normalization is the signed-measure norm: `SignedMeasure.totalVariation` on `Set.univ` is
`‖P - Q‖`, twice the total-variation distance `sup_A |P A - Q A|`, so in terms of that distance the
bound is `choose m 2 / n` (`Measure.totalVariation_toSignedMeasure_sub_univ_le_two_mul_iff`). -/
