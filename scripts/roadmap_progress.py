"""Generate the data behind the site's Progress page: where every roadmap stands.

The Statistics page measures volume (lines of Lean per roadmap, pull-request throughput). This
answers the other question, how far each roadmap has got against its own specification: one row
per roadmap, one segment per layer, beside the pull requests merged under that roadmap's label.
The board describes coverage of the roadmaps that exist, not how much of mathematics is
formalized; there is no inventory of mathematics here to measure against.

Three kinds of evidence go into the output, and the page keeps them apart:

* **Layers** come from the roadmap's own `README.md`: every heading (or bold bullet) that opens
  with `Layer`, `Lane`, `Part`, `Stage`, or a short label such as `L0A` or `S1`. Humans wrote
  these and they do not move when code lands, so they are the unit of progress. Nothing here turns
  them into a percentage: layers are not equal in size, and a partial layer is not half done.

* **Per-layer state** (done / partial / untouched / unassessed) is an assessment of the library at
  a particular revision, and the only place that assessment is made is the generated `STATUS.md`
  that TauCetiProgress writes for a roadmap. Its prose cannot be aggregated, so this script reads
  a machine-readable companion, a `tauceti-coverage:v1` marker beside the `tauceti-status:v1`
  header, when one is present and fits. Fitting means it names this roadmap, the library commit
  of the status header, and the README it assessed (`readme_sha`, a hash of that README's text,
  which must match the README the layers were read from), and lists every layer id exactly once
  with a legal state; each entry may also carry a one-line `remaining` note, what the next
  contributor would pick up. An umbrella roadmap's report carries one such marker per
  sub-roadmap as well, naming it `Parent/Child` and bound to that sub-roadmap's own README; a
  sub-roadmap reads its own marker from the umbrella's report and nothing else there. That is
  what this page will accept, offered as a proposal to
  TauCetiProgress, not a contract it has agreed to; a marker without the README binding is left
  unassessed with a reason rather than applied to whatever README happens to be current. A marker
  bound to an earlier README is still applied when the README names exactly the same layer ids,
  but flagged (`readme_changed`): editing a README is routine, its report lags as every report
  does, and the board shows that as a report due rather than as layers nobody has assessed. A
  re-layered README cannot be mapped onto the old verdicts, so its layers are unassessed. Until
  TauCetiProgress emits such a marker,
  `scripts/roadmap_coverage.json` carries the same verdicts transcribed by hand from the prose.
  A transcription is bound to the exact report it was read from (its library commit and a hash of
  the report's text), to the exact specification it was read against (a hash of the README), and
  to the exact layer ids it names; a rewritten report, an edited README or a re-layered one
  retires it, each with its own reason, rather than letting old states attach to new
  requirements. The states have the standing of the prose: a model's account of the library, not
  a certificate that a layer's whole specification is met, and not something Lean checks.

* **Activity** is mechanical: merged (and, separately, open) pull requests carrying exactly one
  `roadmap/<Area>` label,
  the attribution the Statistics page already relies on. Pull requests with no roadmap label, or
  more than one, are counted in the global figures and reported as unattributed rather than
  assigned to a row. It reads the snapshot the Pages workflow caches for the statistics charts
  (`--data`), so no second walk of GitHub is needed; without one it pages the merged pull
  requests itself through `gh`. Three times are kept apart: when the pull requests were fetched
  (`collected_at`, unknown for a snapshot that does not say), the cutoff up to which they count
  (`cutoff`, which is what "in the last 30 days" is measured from), and when this file was
  written (`exported_at`).

A roadmap under `Completed/` is one the maintainers declared complete against its README. That is
a human decision, recorded separately from any layer assessment; the two are shown side by side
and neither is inferred from the other.

Topics are a hand assignment (`scripts/roadmap_topics.json`) and are labelled as such, and
`scripts/roadmap_links.json` lists per-roadmap pages elsewhere (a contributor's route map, say)
that a row should point at.

Pure stdlib, like the other chart generators, so CI needs no pip install.
