# lint-scope.sh OUT_DIR — decide what the environment lint (scripts/lint-env.sh) covers.
#
# Environment lint normally checks only the TauCeti modules a change touches: not the modules
# they import, and not the modules that import them. A change can still break lint elsewhere (a
# new simp lemma can take an existing one out of simp normal form); the daily full lint
# (.github/workflows/lint-full.yml) catches that and opens a repair PR on `lint-repair/main`.
#
# The whole library is linted when any PR in scope carries the `full-lint` label or is a repair PR
# (head branch `lint-repair/...`), or when the PRs in scope cannot be determined.
#
# Inputs (environment):
#   GH_TOKEN, REPO   GitHub API access and the repository
#   EVENT            pull_request_target | workflow_dispatch | merge_group | repository_dispatch | push
#   NUM              the PR number (pull_request_target, workflow_dispatch)
#   BASE, HEAD       commit SHAs whose three-dot diff is the change: for a PR its base commit and
#                    the exact head being built, so the scope is bound to that immutable commit
#   HEAD_REPO        for a PR, the head repository (owner/name), which may be a fork
#   SCOPE_REPO       exact candidate checkout, with its .git/objects available locally
# Output: if scoped, OUT_DIR/modules.txt lists the changed TauCeti modules (possibly none) and
# `LINT_ONLY_MODULES=OUT_DIR/modules.txt` is appended to $GITHUB_ENV; if not,
# `LINT_ONLY_MODULES=` is. OUT_DIR/unmatched.txt lists every changed `.lean` file that is not one of
# those modules (the root file, a name outside the module pattern such as a non-ASCII one): the lint
# can ignore them, but a check that must see every changed declaration (the axiom audit) cannot, and
# falls back to the whole library when this file is non-empty. It reads GitHub metadata and
# immutable local Git objects through trusted tooling; never candidate code or Git configuration.
