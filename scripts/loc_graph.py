"""Generate a self-contained "lines of code by date" SVG from git history.

Pure stdlib: no third-party dependencies, so CI needs no `pip install`.

For each day on which a matching commit landed, counts the total lines present
in the files matching the given pathspecs at that day's latest commit — exactly
what `wc -l` would report on a checkout. The whole series is reconstructed from
git each run, so there is no state file to keep up to date. Counting the lines
that exist (rather than summing diffs) needs no special handling for merges,
renames, or binary files.

Styled to sit on the dark navy Tau Ceti site (see web/static_files/style.css).

    workflow runs. Plotting only finished days costs at most one day of latency and makes every
