"""Generate the Tau Ceti pull-request statistics SVGs.

The live data path uses GitHub's GraphQL API for every pull request and its label
timeline, plus the repository issue-comments REST endpoint for posted Tau Ceti
scoreboards, keeping only those posted on a fetched pull request and carrying the review
engine's meta block for it.  A normalized snapshot can be written with ``--dump-data``
and replayed with ``--data``; tests and local chart work therefore need no network.

Generated files:

* ``pr-queue-age.svg`` — total open age, awaiting-author age, then in-review age;
* ``review-cycles-reached.svg`` — PRs reaching each review cycle;
* ``rolling-seven-day-history.svg`` — merge throughput, authors, and latency;
* ``cumulative-merges-by-contributor.svg``;
* ``cumulative-reviews-by-contributor.svg``;
* ``merges-by-roadmap-and-contributor.svg`` and ``reviews-by-roadmap-and-contributor.svg``
  — who works where, over a trailing window: by the arXiv category of the roadmap each PR
  advances (``--roadmap-dir``, a TauCetiRoadmap checkout, whose roadmaps each declare one in
  ``metadata.toml``), or by roadmap without one;
* ``pr-stats.json`` — definitions, exact contributor totals, and plotted series.

Contributor charts deliberately draw only the top N contributors plus one aggregate
``Other`` line.  The cap makes the SVG bounded even if the project eventually has
thousands of contributors; exact totals for every login remain in ``pr-stats.json``.
The implementation also stores daily series only for plotted lines, avoiding a
days-times-contributors memory blow-up.

# DO NOT batch timeline queries by aliasing several `pullRequest` fields into one request.
#
# It is tempting, because GitHub prices a request from the connection sizes it asks for and fifty
# aliases score the same single point as one. It was tried, and it silently returns INCOMPLETE
# timelines. Measured against this repository on 2026-09-06: in a 50-alias batch, PR #1556 came
# back with 2 label events and `hasNextPage: false`, where the paginating single-pull-request
# query returns 4 -- the missing one being the `ci-failed` that the pull request currently
# carries. Ten and twenty-five aliases happened to be complete for the same sample, and fifty was
# not, so the limit depends on the total nodes a query asks for and cannot be pinned to a size.
#
# What makes it unusable rather than merely awkward is that `hasNextPage` is computed against the
# truncated slice, so it reports false. There is no signal in the response to detect the loss
# from, and `totalCount` counts unfiltered timeline items, so it cannot stand in for one either.
# Silently dropping label events corrupts every lifecycle number downstream.
#
# The consistency guard in fetch_prs caught this within one deploy, which is the only reason it
# was a failed Pages run rather than quietly wrong statistics. Keep that guard.
#
# The saving would have been small in any case. Reuse (see reusable_timelines) already takes a
# normal run to a few dozen timelines, so batching them into one request saves tens of points out
# of a run costing hundreds. It is not worth a class of error that has no detector.
