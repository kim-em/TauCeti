# Deliberately concrete, and deliberately not `system-ui`/`ui-sans-serif`. These
# charts are served as `<img src="...svg">`, so each SVG is an isolated document
# with no page CSS and no webfont: the family is whatever the host OS resolves.
# One Mac viewing the statistics page rendered every chart title as overlapping
# accented-Latin nonsense while the subtitle and axis labels in the same file
# stayed clean, a split that follows a size boundary near 20px. Two factors set
# the rendered size: css_px below turns a 19-unit title into 19 * viewBox_width
# / 980 user units, and fitting that viewBox to the page column multiplies by
# column_width / viewBox_width. The statistics column is at most --max (1100px),
# so titles land just above 20 CSS px there, barely clearing the boundary,
# whatever a card's viewBox width, while the 13-unit subtitle and 12-unit ticks
# stay in the mid-teens. A few figures sit well above it (participation's
# 42-unit total, the rolling-history card's 24-unit latest values); on the front
# page, where the growth chart is capped at 760px, nothing reaches it. That
# boundary is where macOS has historically switched between optical variants of
# its system font whose glyph IDs disagree, so text shaped against one and drawn
# with the other comes out scrambled; Chromium documents the failure and its
# own fix for it in
# https://web.dev/blog/more-variable-font-options-in-chromium-83 . Whether a
# current macOS and browser still reach that path is not something this
# repository can establish, and naming real faces avoids the question.
