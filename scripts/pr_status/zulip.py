"""Mirror a TauCeti PR's lifecycle onto Zulip emoji reactions.

We keep exactly one bot-owned message per PR in a dedicated channel/topic
(default: "Tau Ceti" > "PRs") and reconcile two independent, mutually-exclusive
groups of emoji reactions on it from the PR's status (see core.derive):

  CI (build) group        review / lifecycle group
    running   -> yellow      review has begun        -> eyes
    passed    -> green_circle review is pending       -> (none)
    failed    -> red_circle  changes_requested/block -> writing
                             all review done, green   -> check
                             merged                   -> merge      (realm emoji)
                             closed, not merged       -> closed-pr  (realm emoji)

The status comes from core.derive, which reads GitHub truth (PR state, the
canonical `<!--tauceti-scoreboard-->` comment's meta JSON, and the `build` commit
status). This sink only renders it, so the same `reconcile` powers both the
event-driven GitHub Actions and a one-shot backfill over historical PRs. Run it
as often as you like; it converges the reactions to match GitHub and nothing else.

Only the *bot's own* reactions are authoritative: presence is judged by the
bot's user id, so a human reacting on a message never confuses reconciliation,
and we only ever add/remove our own reactions.

Usage:
    zulip.py reconcile <pr_number> [--create|--create-if-open] [--strict] [--ci STATE]
    zulip.py backfill [--dry-run] [--strict]  # JSONL PR states on stdin
    zulip.py check

`--create` posts the per-PR message if it does not exist yet (used by the PR
"opened" workflow and when intentionally seeding missing posts). Without it, a
PR with no message yet is left alone (other events only react to an existing
message, never create one). `--create-if-open` is the label-event self-heal: it
creates a missing post only if current GitHub truth still says the PR is open.

`--strict` makes a transient reconciliation error exit non-zero instead of
being swallowed as cosmetic. Normal event-driven runs stay self-healing; the
historical backfill uses strict mode so a partial migration is visible and can
be safely rerun.

`backfill` reads one PR-state JSON object per line from stdin, authenticates the
bot once, edits only messages that already exist, continues past per-PR errors,
and reports all failures at the end. `--dry-run` performs every read and reports
the number of changes without writing messages or reactions.

`check` is a credentials/health probe: it authenticates and confirms the bot is
subscribed to the channel, then exits 0. It touches no PR and no message, so a
scheduled job can run it to catch a broken key during quiet periods, when no PR
event would otherwise exercise the integration.

`--ci STATE` (running|success|failure|none) forces the CI group instead of
deriving it from the `build` commit status. The `pr-build` workflow posts the
`build` status only at the end, so its "requested" event passes `--ci running`
to show 🟡 while the build is in flight.

Environment:
    ZULIP_API_KEY, ZULIP_EMAIL, ZULIP_SITE   bot credentials (required)
    ZULIP_CHANNEL                            default "Tau Ceti"
    ZULIP_TOPIC                              default "PRs"
    GH_REPO                                  default "TauCetiProject/TauCeti"
    GH_TOKEN / GITHUB_TOKEN                  used by `gh` for the GitHub API

The only runtime dependencies are python3's standard library and an
authenticated `gh` CLI -- no third-party packages.

Failure modes are split on purpose, because "a reaction didn't update" and "the
whole integration is dead" deserve different volumes:

  * A *transient* hiccup (one Zulip 5xx, a network blip, a single missing PR)
    is cosmetic and self-heals on the next reconcile, so we log it and exit 0.
  * A *configuration* failure -- missing/empty creds, a bad API key (401), a
    forbidden bot (403), or the bot not subscribed to the channel -- breaks
    every PR and will not fix itself. We log it, emit a GitHub Actions
    `::error::` annotation (visible even under `continue-on-error`), and exit
    non-zero so the workflow run goes red. This is the loud signal that the
    secret needs re-setting; see scripts/pr_status/README.md for the fix.
