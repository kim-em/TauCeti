"""The generated data assets the Pages build carries from `build-data` to `build-site`.

One list, in one place, printed one per line for the workflow to read.

It used to be written out by hand in pages.yml. That made adding a chart two edits in two
different files, and when they landed in two different pull requests the list was silently
wrong: `merges-by-roadmap-and-contributor.svg` and `reviews-by-roadmap-and-contributor.svg`
were generated into `web/static_files` and then not carried, so the site referenced two images
that never arrived. Nothing failed -- the artifact was simply missing them.

Derive the pull-request, daily CI, and roadmap completion assets from each generator's
`ASSET_NAMES`. The rest is named here because those generators take their output path
from the workflow rather than declaring it, so there is nothing to import.
