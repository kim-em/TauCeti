"""The generated-asset list must cover what the generators write and what the site asks for.

Two lists drifted apart once already: `pages.yml` carried a hand-written allowlist while
`pr_stats_graphs.ASSET_NAMES` grew two entries, so the roadmap/contributor grids were
generated and then dropped on the floor between jobs. Nothing failed -- the artifact was
simply missing them, and the site referenced two images that never arrived.
